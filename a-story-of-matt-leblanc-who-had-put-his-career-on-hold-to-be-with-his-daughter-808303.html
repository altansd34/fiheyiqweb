That’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a>’s case: he&nbsp;rose to&nbsp;fame thanks to&nbsp;his work as&nbsp;Joey Tribbiani in&nbsp;<i><a href=# title=Friends data-link=tag>Friends</a> </i>and made&nbsp;us fall in&nbsp;love with his seductive personality, humor, and the famous line: “How you doin’?” However, away from the spotlight of&nbsp;the cameras, the actor went through some challenging times. From not having any money to&nbsp;the illness his daughter was diagnosed with when she was 8&nbsp;months old.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;find in&nbsp;Matt LeBlanc a&nbsp;story that inspires&nbsp;us to&nbsp;overcome life’s difficult moments, step up&nbsp;in&nbsp;tough times, and overcome adversity until the sun shines again.</p><p><h2>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;acting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/698/0a0/9ff761595ca3b5f0be3ebe2a56.jpg><p>Unlike many celebrities, who know they want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;into acting, young Matt LeBlanc didn’t even dream about that. His <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passion</a> was motorcycles, and he&nbsp;also trained to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;carpentry.</p><p>He&nbsp;dropped out of&nbsp;college in&nbsp;his second semester and decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;New York to&nbsp;try his luck as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, but was told that his height was not a&nbsp;good match for that profession. However, he&nbsp;was not discouraged, and he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;sign with an&nbsp;agent at&nbsp;an&nbsp;audition. He&nbsp;made the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>jump</a> to&nbsp;television after starring in&nbsp;commercials for well-known brands such as&nbsp;Levi’s, Coca-Cola, Heinz, and Doritos.</p><p><h2>The doors to&nbsp;<i>Friends</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80e/e65/55740658a4bd92c2edea81ea5a.jpg><p>Matt managed to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;some&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TV series</a> like <i>TV&nbsp;101. </i>He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;recurring role in&nbsp;<i>Married... with Children </i>too. But none of&nbsp;these gigs gave him the financial stability he&nbsp;needed, let alone the leap to&nbsp;fame he&nbsp;sought. Before <i>Friends</i>’ success, the actor had only $11 left and was constantly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scraping</a>&nbsp;by, for example, fixing his teeth himself, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;couldn’t afford a&nbsp;dentist.</p><p><h2>The timeless Joey Tribbiani</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69e/e2f/ae43ae58a18889b0e268938b12.jpg><p>Choosing Matt LeBlanc was hard for the show’s producers, who told <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Friends: The Reunion</i></a><i> </i>that they were torn between him and Louis Mandylor. The latter ended up&nbsp;appearing in&nbsp;the series anyway, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different role. He&nbsp;was Joey’s “twin brother.” LeBlanc’s character in&nbsp;<i>Friends</i> will always be&nbsp;remembered for his charisma, lack of&nbsp;common sense, his huge and generous heart, and his “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ability</a>” to&nbsp;speak French.</p><p><h2>Then he&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b9/ce2/9295775c9e80ac0ab4454d3975.jpg><p><i>Friends</i> came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end on&nbsp;May&nbsp;6, 2004. A&nbsp;year earlier, Matt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> Melissa McKnight, an&nbsp;American actress, and he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;father that same year. But sadly, things did not go&nbsp;as&nbsp;the happy couple had hoped, as, at&nbsp;8&nbsp;months of&nbsp;age, their daughter started to&nbsp;suffer seizures.</p><p><h2>After <i>Friends</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14c/556/2d3e455efc988a612b5d8d088c.jpg><p>After the sitcom ended, Matt continued to&nbsp;play his character in&nbsp;the spin-off of&nbsp;the same name, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Joey</i></a>. The series was later canceled, and he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;step away from the world of&nbsp;television to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with his daughter Marina. She was diagnosed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cortical dysplasia</a>, a&nbsp;brain disorder that affects neurological functions.</p><p>Matt realized that his daughter had a&nbsp;problem when, while crawling, she would always fall on&nbsp;her left side. When she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed</a>, they were warned that the disease could even affect her vocal cords, making it&nbsp;impossible for her to&nbsp;speak.</p><p><h2>Farewell to&nbsp;television</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e81/3d5/dc21dc5346a41fb9242138bbbd.jpg><p>In&nbsp;October 2006, Matt <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> Melissa McKnight. From that year until 2011, he&nbsp;completely distanced himself from the media. “I&nbsp;didn’t feel like being funny, there was a&nbsp;lot going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;personal life.... I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;my&nbsp;marriage was doomed to&nbsp;fail, we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;great relationship before. Maybe it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;daughter’s illness. Maybe I&nbsp;lost myself, focusing too much on&nbsp;my&nbsp;work,” he&nbsp;stated in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><p>“For years and years, I&nbsp;hardly left the house. I&nbsp;was burned out. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;have no&nbsp;commitments and not be&nbsp;anywhere. And I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;position to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that. Most actors call their agents and ask what they have for them. I&nbsp;called mine and told him to&nbsp;lose my&nbsp;number for a&nbsp;few years. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;dark time. I&nbsp;almost had a&nbsp;nervous breakdown,” he&nbsp;told <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Mirror</i></a>.</p><p><h2>Love for his daughter above all else</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/606/cb7/a9ec785b938edd96ce0b54fe86.jpg><p>Coleman-Rayner / Coleman Rayner / East News</p><p>After separating from his wife and leaving television, LeBlanc went to&nbsp;live on&nbsp;a&nbsp;ranch in&nbsp;California with his daughter, even though they share joint custody. “My&nbsp;daughter was diagnosed with a&nbsp;brain problem. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very dark period, but we&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;get through it&nbsp;— don’t they say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger?” he&nbsp;told <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Mirror</i></a>.</p><p>“I&nbsp;remember when she was born. From the moment&nbsp;I looked at&nbsp;her, I&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love, and&nbsp;I had never felt that way before. I&nbsp;couldn’t believe&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;knew in&nbsp;that instant that nothing would stop me&nbsp;from loving her, even if&nbsp;she crashed my&nbsp;Ferrari.”</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;happy ending to&nbsp;a&nbsp;big scare</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c5/f04/087eb251b59e26028aaaa093c5.jpg><p>Marina <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>overcame</a> her illness; today, she enjoys watching <i>Friends</i> with her father. The actor said that if&nbsp;they’re flipping through the channels and the series comes&nbsp;on, they leave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;watch the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>episode</a>. “She loves to&nbsp;ask me&nbsp;questions like: ’Was that real? Did you really eat that? Did you eat it&nbsp;off the floor? That’s disgusting! You’re funny, Dad!’”.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;this personal part of&nbsp;the actor’s life?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uv9OoqbJln5t6rq3TrWSlnZKhrq%2BvjLCfqGWYlrFuvNStZKGho2Kwor7Enqlmp55itbC4w2arqGWSmnq4tdOhZKGho2KxosHGoaueql1tfXl%2Fj2xm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
