Rather, the professional dancer is reportedly living her best life without any romantic attachment to anyone.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julianne Hough is Seizing Her Single Era</h2><p>Apparently, the two-time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> champion is practicing self-care in her single era. An insider claimed that Hough is not looking for a commitment at the moment and is focusing on herself instead.</p><p>“She’s staying busy by working, traveling, spending time with loved ones, and prioritizing her mind, body, and soul,” the insider said. “She hasn’t been dating anyone seriously.”</p><p>For those who may not know, Julianne’s brother Derek Hough is expected to marry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hayley Erbert</a> this weekend. As per the insider, the DWTS co-host will be attending without a plus-one.</p><p>“Derek and Hayley’s wedding is coming up soon and as of now, Julianne isn’t planning to bring a date,” the source claimed.</p><p>Hough was previously married to ice hockey player Brooks Laich for almost three years. The now-estranged couple revealed their split in May 2020 and eventually finalized their divorce in February 2021.</p><p>At present, the 35-year-old dancing pro is fixated at flourishing her career. Particularly, Hough is busy preparing for her hosting duties alongside Alfonso Ribeiro for the looming season 32 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a>.</p><p>As Julianne gears up for her new role on the dancing reality series, Derek is every inch a proud brother. The DWTS judge recently shared his thoughts to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OK!</a> regarding Julianne’s latest job.</p><p>“It makes perfect sense. It’s the perfect decision, really. She’s part of the family, not just with me, but the whole show. She was there from the beginning and a two-time champion. She’s a great host, and her familiarity with the show is amazing. I’m very excited,” her brother stated.</p><p>Derek further stated that he’s particularly excited to see his sister and Ribeiro’s chemistry and energy. He also supposed that the two “could probably do a full dance routine together.”</p><p>Hough was named as co-host of DWTS in March. Basically, she will serve as replacement of Tyra Banks who resigned from the job after season 31. After the announcement, Hough reflected on her upcoming role.</p><p>“It’s full circle being able to come back from being a dancer to a judge and now co-hosting with Alfonso,” she said. “It’s amazing. Honestly, it’s just family again. I’m just excited. I can’t wait to see everybody back on the dance floor and just get our groove on.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_SofiaVergara_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara Posts Glow-Up Photos By The Poolside After Her Divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ya6jopmeo7JutM6unqFlmah6tLXNoKOeZZaksLa%2FyKeeZqeeYrWmvtKeo59n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
