Within the video, the America’s Got Talent alum are hanging upside down proving that their high-risk act is not for the faint of heart.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duo-transcend-keeps-fans-on-the-edge-of-their-seats>Duo Transcend Keeps Fans on the Edge of Their Seats</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Duo Transcend</a> is still wowing audiences in Las Vegas as part of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT Las Vegas Live</a> show. Since fans love their act, the married couple Tyce Nielsen and Mary Wolfe-Nielsen, recently showed fans what it’s like to be on their side of the act.</p><p>For those who may not remember, the couple’s trapeze act features Tyce hanging upside down, while holding on to Mary. Their act continues to be exciting, as they add more and more thrilling tricks to their routines.</p><p>Fans are astonished by the couple’s recent video. It’s really quite cool to see what Tyce does during the act. The video show’s the husband’s perspective while he keeps catching his wife while being suspended in midair. The video has gained the amazement of many fans with most of them expressing their shock at witnessing their act from a different view.</p><p>One fan commented, “What a cool perspective!! Looks even more dangerous!! This is great! What an awesome idea!”</p><p>Currently, Duo Transcend is being hailed as one of the best Trapeze performers around. They have competed in various shows including AGT and its spinoff AGT: The Champions becoming finalists in both shows. Fans hope to see the couple return in the upcoming spin off, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All-Stars</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Working Out is the Couple’s Favorite Pastime</h2><p>A big part of being able to perform their death-defying acts is their physiques. It is no secret that the couple does a lot of practice prior to performing. Without staying in tip top shape, they wouldn’t be able to execute their acts safely. Even when the couple is not practicing they’re still physically active.</p><p>Duo Transcend often posts their couple workouts on their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Instagram</a>, doing exercises normal people can’t do. Their workouts would include bodyweight exercises and high-difficulty strength training that would put gym goers to shame.</p><p>The couple would need to be at the top of their game when doing guest performances with their Las Vegas residency. There’s currently nothing stopping Duo Transcend from competing in future game shows where they have an extremely good chance at winning.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_ChristinaAguilera_Rodin-Eckenroth_Wireimage-for-ABA.jpg alt="Christina Aguilera Sends Powerful Message in New Version of “Beautiful”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w66mZqyilru0r8Snm2ahnaW%2Fpr%2FSnqpmmZepeqetzaxksKGknXqxsdGfpqulkaOwpnnPqK1mrpmZsrB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
