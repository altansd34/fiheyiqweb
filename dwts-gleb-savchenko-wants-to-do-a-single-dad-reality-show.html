The performer is still adjusting to life as a single dad, and is enjoying the bonding time he gets to experience with his children.</p><p>“It’s everything. Starting from waking up in the morning, to doing their hair, making breakfast, taking them to school, doing activities … just being a dad, it’s an amazing thing,” Savchenko, 37, said in the <a href=#>interview</a>. “It’s funny because when we were together, with Elena, I didn’t have that much time with them. Because either I was on tour, or on the season, and&nbsp;we had a full-time nanny.”</p><p>Now, Savchenko’s focus remains on raising his two girls.
