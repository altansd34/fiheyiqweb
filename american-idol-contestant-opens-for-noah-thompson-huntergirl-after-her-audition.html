Fans online are divided over whether this was fair.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-contestant-mariah-faith-opens-for-noah-thompson-huntergirl>American Idol Contestant Mariah Faith Opens for Noah Thompson, HunterGirl</h2><p>During Sunday’s new episode, Mariah Faith earned three “yes” votes and a Golden Ticket from the judges for her audition. Judge Katy Perry told her she has “one of the most interesting voices this season.” Mariah also got a special surprise.</p><p>The judges invited Mariah to open for Season 20 winner and runner-up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Noah Thompson and HunterGirl</a>, who were performing a concert in Nashville the day after her audition. Mariah got emotional, calling it “the best feeling in the whole world.”</p><p>“Performing on this stage means so much to me,” Mariah said at the concert. “All the doubt I ever had as an artist or in myself just got swept completely away from me.”</p><p>The official American Idol Instagram shared a photo of Mariah posing with the two Season 20 singers on the night of the concert. The post is captioned, “An Idol among HER Idols!”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’ RUNNER-UP HUNTERGIRL IS GOING ON TOUR</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-some-fans-took-issue-with-mariah-s-opening-gig>Some Fans Took Issue with Mariah’s Opening Gig</h2><p>Although some fans offered their congratulations for Mariah in the comments of Idol‘s Instagram post, others took issue with the fact that she got to open for last year’s winner. They saw it as unfair to the other contestants on this season.</p><p>User @highfitnesssue suggested that this would give Mariah an “unfair advantage going into the competition” or might even be “a curse because she has to consistently [live] up to that expectation.”</p><p>Another user, @tam_tam_tom, suggested that they would be “pissed if I were any of the other candidates,” even going so far as to say that Mariah should be disqualified.</p><p>“Well, don’t need to watch this season now that we know who ends up winning the whole show before Hollywood week even happens,” wrote user @206photography.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the winner of Season 21 hasn’t been decided, as the live shows have yet to air. It’s also nothing new for certain contestants to get special treatment from the judges, as the show introduced the Platinum Ticket last season for that very purpose.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_LiamPayne_Transformation-220x147.jpg alt="The Real Story Behind Liam Payne’s Shocking New Look" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2abn6PBpr%2FTmqWtZZ%2Blsq%2B%2FjJ%2Bmq2WepK6pedOhpqaoo6S7brTUp6ueqpeev615wJ%2BrnqpdnbKzecCum6KsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
