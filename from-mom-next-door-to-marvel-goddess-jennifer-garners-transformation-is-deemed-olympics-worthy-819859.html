The actress, who is reprising her role as Elektra after nearly two decades, shared an intense workout montage on <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> that has fans and fitness enthusiasts alike <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calling</a> her routine "Olympics worthy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/03a/abb/e883e35a75990ce843d7625570.png><p>In an Instagram video, Garner offers a glimpse into the grueling months-long training regimen she undertook to get back into superhero shape. The comprehensive routine included everything from rigorous cardio circuits and weight training to swimming, boxing, and even water aerobics. Garner's dedication to her craft is evident as she pushes through high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts and practices complex stunt choreography.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/18e/74e/5a80125852b7ec9ee8db4fe7ab.png><p>"Other than trying to convince my kids’ preschool <a href=# title=buddies data-link=tag>buddies</a> that I was secretly a ninja, I hadn’t picked up Elektra’s sais since 2004," Garner quipped in her Instagram caption. She added, "I was fit, but not <a href=# title=Marvel data-link=tag>Marvel</a> fit," highlighting the next-level fitness required for superhero roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d31/ee3/6d77a35926bab5bc11fa847247.png><p>The actress revealed that once her cameo was confirmed, she "amped up" her training significantly. Her superhero summer, as she called it, consisted of twice-daily workouts, thrice-weekly boxing sessions, and "lots and lots" of Peloton classes.
