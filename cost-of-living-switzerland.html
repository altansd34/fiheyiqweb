But you had better be prepared to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of living in this beautiful country because the cost of living in Switzerland is one of the highest in Europe.</p><p>Want to know whether it’s cheaper to live in Germany or Switzerland? Or how much you’ll need to live in Zurich for a year? Read on for answers to these questions and more.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your 7-day free trial</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What’s-the-cost-of-living-in-Switzerland?>What’s the cost of living in Switzerland?</h2><p>Breaking news: Switzerland is expensive. I’m joking obviously, most people are very aware that Switzerland has a high cost of living. Life in Zurich can set you back as much as, or more than, living in other wealthy cities like Singapore and Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the cost of living varies depending on your lifestyle, who you live with and in which area of Switzerland you choose to settle. The cities are more expensive than rural areas and having children will bump up your monthly expenses thanks to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CHF 2,000</a> you can spend per month on a creche (kindergarten).</p><p>On average, a single person living in Zurich will pay about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CHF 2,000</a> per month for a one-bedroom apartment and another CHF 1,500 for other living costs. Counted in this are groceries – at least CHF 100 per week – utilities and health insurance. If you’re a family of four, expect your monthly expenses to be around CHF 5,300, with rent for a three-bedroom apartment in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zurich</a> costing over CHF 3,000. Look at the table to see how much you need to live in Switzerland for a year.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Average cost of living in Zurich per year</h3><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>CHF</strong></td><td><strong>USD</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Single person</strong></td><td>42,000</td><td>46,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Family of four</strong></td><td>100,000</td><td>110,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Interested in moving to Switzerland?

Whatever your job, you’re likely to be able to cover your basic cost of living, though those in lower-paid jobs might have to share a flat with a friend or partner in larger cities to make ends meet.</p><p>The average annual salary in Switzerland is about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CHF 60,000</a> or CHF 5,000 per month. This is a good, liveable salary in the country. Nurses make about CHF 68,000 while teachers average out at CHF 87,000 a year. An IT systems specialist will clock in at a hefty <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CHF 117,000 per year</a>.</p><p>Switzerland’s hidden language?

A one-bedroom apartment in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Berlin</a> costs less than half as much as in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zurich</a> and childcare in Berlin costs around <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CHF 115</a> per month compared to the whopping CHF 2,000 I mentioned earlier in Zurich. For those of you more used to Euros, that’s around EUR 105 in Berlin vs. EUR 1,840 in Zurich.</p><p>Want to eat out? Head to Germany for cheaper prices. A meal for two in a mid-range restaurant will cost about half as much in Germany as in Switzerland: CHF 54 vs. CHF 120. Even in McDonald’s, you’ll pay about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CHF 8</a> for a meal in Berlin compared to CHF 15 in Zurich – yep, that’s almost EUR 14 for a meal in McDonald’s.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cost of living per month in CHF and EUR</h3><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Zurich</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>Berlin</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>CHF</strong></td><td><strong>EUR</strong></td><td><strong>CHF</strong></td><td><strong>EUR</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Single person</strong></td><td>3,500</td><td>3,200</td><td>1,700</td><td>1,560</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Family of four</strong></td><td>8,300</td><td>7,600</td><td>3,700</td><td>3,400</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>So it’s better to live in Germany, right?

But, salaries are lower too: an average of 43% lower, so again, the expense of Switzerland is made up for by the high salaries.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=So,-what’s-the-cost-of-living-in-Switzerland-like?>So, what’s the cost of living in Switzerland like?</h2><p>Well, it’s confirmed: Switzerland is pretty expensive. But the eye-watering cost of living is softened by the excellent salaries for jobs across all sectors and while it is more expensive to live in Zurich than in many other cities in Europe, you’ll still have plenty of money left over at the end of the month.&nbsp;<br>If you’ve been inspired to move to Switzerland, check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how to make your CV work for international employers</a>.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Start your 7-day free trial</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
