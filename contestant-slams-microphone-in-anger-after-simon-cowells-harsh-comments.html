They sang a version of “Umbrella” by Rihanna that left the judges less than impressed. But it was one group member’s attitude and rude comments to the judges that made this audition memorable for all of the wrong reasons.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-jAfp1BT00</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-triple-trouble-received-harsh-critiques-from-simon-cowell>Triple Trouble Received Harsh Critiques From Simon Cowell</h2><p>When Triple Trouble began singing, it became clear that a singing career was not in their cards. Simon Cowell could not stop laughing throughout the performance. Cheryl looked around as she tried not to laugh. Louis Walsh cringed while watching their audition. Simon finally reached his hand up to stop the song.</p><p>“Have you all got colds?” Simon Cowell asked. Group member, George Gerasimou was not too happy with this question. “That was a racket wasn’t it,” Simon said through laughter. The audience laughed along with him as Triple Trouble awkwardly stood on the stage.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>ANGRY DUO MAKES OFFENSIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE JUDGES ON ‘THE X FACTOR’</a></strong></p><p>“That’s kind of rude, you know” George fired back. “You need to get off of your high horse and stop talking rubbish at me.” He continued to rant into the microphone but luckily the “boos” of the audience made his words inaudible. “Shut up” he screamed into the microphone over the roar of the crowd</p><p>Check out the compilation below to see 10 rude contestants that challenged the judges on talent shows.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Triple Trouble left the stage after George’s angry rant. As he walked backstage, he threw the microphone onto the floor. “Simon is a mug seriously” George declared backstage.</p><p>“Nasty, nasty nasty” Simon uttered. George warned Simon to sleep with one eye open and was certain that the group would be back on the show one day.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-george-returned-to-the-show-with-more-anger-than-ever-before>George Returned To The Show With More Anger Than Ever Before</h3><p>George returned to audition for The X Factor UK in 2011. This time, he ditched performing with a group and decided to perform as a solo act. One of his former bandmates from Triple Trouble accompanied him for moral support. He claimed that he was a new person who was not as “aggressive” and “unapproachable” as he was the first time around.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Tulisa immediately recognized George during his audition for his previous angry tirade. Sadly Simon was not present on the judging panel to see George’s big return to the show. During his audition, he ran down to sing right in front of the judge’s table. They called for the music to stop and George looked shocked. Security escorted him back onto the stage. The judges questioned whether or not George has actually matured since his first audition.</p><p>After hearing the judge’s critiques, George <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">began shouting expletives at Tulisa.</a> He flashed the middle finger to the judges and the audience as he was escorted off the stage by security. He stormed off cursing out the camera crew and the host.</p><p>In 2017 George reemerged online to set the record straight about his two infamous bad auditions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH ANGRY GIRL GROUP INSULT RUDE SIMON COWELL AS YOU’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE</a></strong></p><p>In the video, George confirms that he went on The X Factor UK twice as a joke and is aware that he cannot sing.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Heidi-Klum-.jpeg alt="Heidi Klum Posts Throwback Video From First Victoria’s Secret Show And You Don’t Want To Miss It!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The X Factor UK</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqilrZ2jqa6vwIyso5qlo2K6qq%2FRqKehp56aeqq6jJqloJ2iYq6nwMSrZKyhnaS7bq%2FOsJylpKNitaK%2B0qFknKedorKvwNJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
