<span class=val><a href=./categories/celeb>Celeb</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>11 Celebrities Who Shunned Cosmetic Surgery and Embraced Their Natural Look</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Most people are of&nbsp;the opinion that show business and <a href=# title="cosmetic surgery" data-link=tag>cosmetic surgery</a> go&nbsp;hand in&nbsp;hand. And they can’t be&nbsp;blamed for&nbsp;it. After all, there are many celebrities out there who follow a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;<a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a> that are far from being real— or&nbsp;realistic. And, many times, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;comply with these, they feel the need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through surgery as&nbsp;many times as&nbsp;necessary. Still, it’s important to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind that there are other celebrities who, empowered as&nbsp;they are, are encouraged to&nbsp;accept that they will grow old and their body will age. They celebrate natural bodies.</p><p>And <strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;make people aware of&nbsp;this very healthy new trend that shows how acceptance can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice too, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;11&nbsp;celebrities who’ve refused to&nbsp;get plastic surgery.</p><p><h2>1. Julia Roberts</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/75f/f5d/84f7aa59e3a077c74788724910.jpg><p>She has one of&nbsp;the most charming smiles in&nbsp;Hollywood, and is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the celebrities who chose to&nbsp;stay away from plastic surgery. “I&nbsp;want my&nbsp;kids to&nbsp;know when I’m pissed, when I’m happy, and when I’m confounded. Your face tells a&nbsp;story and it&nbsp;shouldn’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;story about your drive to&nbsp;the doctor’s office,” Roberts explained when she was <a href=#>interviewed</a> by&nbsp;People magazine after becoming the new face for Lancome’s ad&nbsp;campaign.</p><p><h2>2. Helen Mirren</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f18/58e/707cc750bdaa26f2cb0d739834.jpg><p>At&nbsp;75, the Oscar winner that starred in&nbsp;<a href=#>movie</a> The Queen looks gorgeous. But her beauty has absolutely nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with plastic surgery. It’s more about resorting to&nbsp;a&nbsp;few makeup tricks and cutting her hair herself. “I&nbsp;did not want that overly smooth face that’s hardly recognizable. I’ve been retouched in&nbsp;movie posters and&nbsp;I look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;and&nbsp;go: ’Well, it’s all very well, I&nbsp;look kind of&nbsp;great, but, it’s not me&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. It’s some construct up&nbsp;there,” declared the actress during an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> with British paper The Daily Mail. And she says that the only procedure she recently had done is&nbsp;tattooing her eyebrows, which she <a href=#>says</a> boosted her confidence to&nbsp;new levels.</p><p><h2>3. Winona Ryder</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/717/17b/2573c250629574a5656061c9c5.jpg><p><a href=# title="Winona Ryder" data-link=tag>Winona Ryder</a> is&nbsp;another example of&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress that feels comfortable in&nbsp;her own skin, regardless of&nbsp;her age, and has no&nbsp;intention whatsoever of&nbsp;undergoing plastic surgery, or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least none that we&nbsp;know&nbsp;of. She does, however, recognize the pressure that actors and actresses feel in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;this question. The actress from <a href=#>Edward Scissorhands</a> prefers to&nbsp;stay away from surgery because, according to&nbsp;her own words, she actually <a href=#>loves getting older</a> and has waited a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;older appearance.</p><p><h2>4. Tina Fey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6dd/f19/25cfb456a09133d894531125f9.jpg><p>Comedian and screenwriter Tina Fey says that she likes the challenge of&nbsp;her changing appearance as&nbsp;she grows old. She still admits to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;little confused about the tendency to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;every single sign of&nbsp;aging before it&nbsp;can even be&nbsp;noticed. She also <a href=#>says</a> that she prefers to&nbsp;not use <a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;magical cure for everything and instead tries to&nbsp;just stay in&nbsp;shape.</p><p><h2>5. Diane Keaton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b9/8d7/a55de25fe89d62b9a7b745b814.jpg><p>During an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> with People magazine, Annie Hall’s star said she has a&nbsp;great method to&nbsp;figure out who has had plastic surgery and who hasn’t. It&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;just looking at&nbsp;their hands, and if&nbsp;these vary in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;their face, it&nbsp;means that the person probably underwent some kind of&nbsp;surgery at&nbsp;some point. Still, her firm stance against surgery doesn’t mean that she neglects her appearance. Instead, it&nbsp;actually proves that her secrets to&nbsp;looking beautiful, namely exercising and not dyeing her hair to&nbsp;brighten up&nbsp;her face, work like a&nbsp;charm.</p><p><h2>6. Brigitte Bardot</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c3/6e8/7d1b0a5b1d8a0ced7523534ae6.jpg><p>Once known as&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;French fashion, model and actress Brigitte Bardot has consistently <a href=#>said</a> “no” to&nbsp;plastic surgery, making it&nbsp;very clear that her days as&nbsp;an&nbsp;international personality were over when she shot her last movie back in&nbsp;1973. Today, the actress is&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;the fight for animal rights, and on&nbsp;her 86th birthday, she made <a href=#>one of&nbsp;her wishes</a> come true&nbsp;— to&nbsp;make sure that we&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;race get to&nbsp;a&nbsp;point in&nbsp;which we&nbsp;treat animals with respect.</p><p><h2>7. Rachel Hunter</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a8/7cd/9d53cc5fbbad845abd743a8f14.jpg><p>Despite being a&nbsp;model and appearing on&nbsp;the covers of&nbsp;the most popular magazines of&nbsp;the fashion industry, <a href=#>Hunter</a> says she is&nbsp;horrified when she looks at&nbsp;pictures of&nbsp;herself. And that is&nbsp;even though she’s actually comfortable with the way she looks in&nbsp;real life. However, her perception of&nbsp;herself changed when she started working on&nbsp;the television series Rachel Hunter’s Tour of&nbsp;Beauty.</p><p>“After going on&nbsp;this journey and seeing other cultures, away went that superficial idea of&nbsp;beauty. Our ideas of&nbsp;beauty are old and need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shattered. We&nbsp;have no&nbsp;self-acceptance,” she told British newspaper The Daily Mail during an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Amanda Peet</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/720/aab/54b7005391a79b0a2b8f62c545.jpg><p>During an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> with People magazine, actress Amanda Peet from Dirty John said that her daughters are one of&nbsp;the main reasons she would never have plastic surgery. She adds that we’re all going to&nbsp;get wrinkles, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;down the road of&nbsp;acceptance instead of&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;hide our aging body. That, of&nbsp;course, doesn’t mean that Peet doesn’t worry about having a&nbsp;nice appearance. She still resorts to&nbsp;tooth whitening treatments, hair dyeing, and anti-aging creams.</p><p><h2>9. Pink</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/185/f15/d35a4a5a5e8989aa5d73d69c34.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;reminder note to&nbsp;herself that she posted on&nbsp;<a href=#>her Twitter account</a>, Pink wrote: “Dear&nbsp;Me, you’re getting older. I&nbsp;see lines. Especially when you smile. Your nose is&nbsp;getting bigger. You look (and feel) weird as&nbsp;you get used to&nbsp;this new reality. But your nose looks like your kids, and your face wrinkles where you laugh.” According to&nbsp;her own <a href=#>statements</a>, the singer and songwriter chooses to&nbsp;accept the natural aging process and does not support any type of&nbsp;plastic surgery.</p><p><h2>10. Judi Dench</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/236/1d5/6f0e1a5063a5f5aeb21d081945.jpg><p>The British <a href=#>actress</a> and writer defends the idea of&nbsp;aging naturally and is&nbsp;against all kinds of&nbsp;cosmetic surgery. However, she did admit that she once considered going under the knife. “Every time I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;America I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;some process where it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;all sucked out and&nbsp;I could be&nbsp;there in&nbsp;time for dinner, but I’m frightened it&nbsp;would all drop off under the anesthetic,” <a href=#>said</a> the Oscar winner jokingly after her astonishing performance in&nbsp;Shakespeare in&nbsp;Love.</p><p><h2>11. Jennifer Aniston</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d02/26d/67a2d35841a580666a97dabbf5.jpg><p>Aniston <a href=#>agrees</a> with several of&nbsp;the women on&nbsp;this list about the fact that people in&nbsp;showbiz feel a&nbsp;certain pressure to&nbsp;stop the passage of&nbsp;time. And she explains that she doesn’t shoot anything into her face because there are other things that women can do&nbsp;to&nbsp;look young and beautiful. She mentions hydration, facial massages, and creams as&nbsp;examples of&nbsp;those.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition, the actress believes that fashion should broaden up&nbsp;its beauty standards to&nbsp;include people of&nbsp;all ages, not just perfect 20-year-old women.</p><p>If&nbsp;you were just as&nbsp;rich as&nbsp;these stars are would you get some part of&nbsp;your body done? Which part and why? And if&nbsp;not, why do&nbsp;you think it’s a&nbsp;bad idea?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecKeo56aop7BqrHSZq6hp12otba6zZ6bZpufqLqmwMicZKytopyys8WMmqWdZZWir7Otwp6bZqyYmrazec2aq66qkaF6rbvOpGRxaGBlhXV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
