For many women, it&nbsp;gets very frustrating and affects their psychological health. We&nbsp;should remember that <a href=# title=society data-link=tag>society</a> needs to&nbsp;take time to&nbsp;understand them more and stop judging people who don’t have their own <a href=# title=families data-link=tag>families</a> or&nbsp;kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2a/438/c4e42b5baeba7a4bda84bf42d5.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, Elizabeth Banks welcomed a&nbsp;baby via <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surrogate,</a> but before she became a&nbsp;happy mother, the actress had to&nbsp;experience a&nbsp;hard time with infertility. Not so&nbsp;long ago, Banks decided to&nbsp;share with the public something that is&nbsp;not often discussed but is&nbsp;worth exploring.</p><p>“I’ve never been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnant,</a> and when&nbsp;I was young, I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was because&nbsp;I was really good at&nbsp;taking the pill, which&nbsp;I definitely was. But I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;idea. There’s a&nbsp;small percentage of&nbsp;women who basically have unexplained infertility, and that is&nbsp;me, I’m in&nbsp;that category. I&nbsp;had always had plenty of&nbsp;eggs, I&nbsp;never had trouble making embryos, but they did not implant. For whatever reason, my&nbsp;uterus is&nbsp;hostile, I&nbsp;don’t know what’s going&nbsp;on, but they just will not stay in&nbsp;there. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;broken belly, is<strong>&nbsp;what&nbsp;I told my&nbsp;kids, mommy had a&nbsp;broken belly</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/73a/221/42e14d5a04b4af3525a11c3f25.jpg><p>AXELLE WOUSSEN/Bauer Griffin/East News</p><p>The actress talks about one important thing that affects modern women: public judgment about the decision to&nbsp;pick a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surrogate</a>. “This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time ago before surrogacy was like a&nbsp;Kardashian thing. <strong>Nobody was doing it&nbsp;back then</strong>,” Banks said. And she’s right&nbsp;— that route wasn’t popular 11&nbsp;years ago, and you could hardly explain to&nbsp;society that you wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;big family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e16/726/7641be5fca961280ea4ddaebcf.jpg><p>Another thing that can mess with your psychology is&nbsp;that women are often judged if&nbsp;they don’t have a&nbsp;husband or&nbsp;kids. “But for women, especially in&nbsp;a&nbsp;society that’s like, this is&nbsp;why we&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>value</a> you, we&nbsp;don’t value you because you could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;CEO, we&nbsp;value you because you can procreate and keep the race going. <strong>So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you can’t do&nbsp;that, you are less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman</strong>. That’s the message,” explained Banks. “And my&nbsp;fertility was something&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;mourn. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;grieve for&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;loss. And I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;really work through that before&nbsp;I could invite someone else to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;make my&nbsp;family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ef/219/18714d506ba27fe5a56d69c6f3.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/755/b34/65528052a48007dc066400ba56.jpg><p>Despite all the physical issues, the actress tried to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything she could do&nbsp;to&nbsp;increase her chance of&nbsp;giving birth on&nbsp;her own, but in&nbsp;the end, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realized</a> that <strong>her goal wasn’t to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pregnant but to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom</strong>,<strong> </strong>and that’s when her decision was made. Surrogacy was chosen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;would come with some gossip among the public.</p><p>Banks still keeps in&nbsp;touch with the surrogate mother, who has 3&nbsp;kids and a&nbsp;husband of&nbsp;her own.</p><p>Time has passed, and Banks now <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realizes</a> that people’s judgment shouldn’t stop you from making the right decisions, saying, “<strong>Now they get to&nbsp;judge me&nbsp;for how I&nbsp;parent</strong>. It&nbsp;starts all over again, it’s a&nbsp;whole other side of&nbsp;the cycle.”</p><p>How many kids do&nbsp;you have?
