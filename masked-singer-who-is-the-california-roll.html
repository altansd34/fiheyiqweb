And in this week’s episode, they’re tackling the city that never sleeps! With two new costumes, California Roll will be going head-to-head with Medusa and Polar Bear. From the previews, it looks like this could be a famous trio!</strong></p><p>But what else do we know about the California Roll? And who could the celebrities underneath the masks be? Let’s find out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Preview of The Masked Singer New York Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 9</h2><p>California Roll stormed the stage with FIVE pieces! That first clue tells us a lot because there are five singers on the stage now. The first clue we got was from California Roll in a surfer voice talking about being from California. We see a bottle of soy sauce and he references wasabi. He then casually mentions that he’s “already been on Broadway.”</p><p>Another piece with a more feminine voice claims that “this entree has many sides.” She lists out five reasons why she’s “the perfect dish,” starting with the fact that they have a degree from an Ivy League school. Second, one of them says he was a DJ. We then see a map with a red “X” on it. Next, a caricature with California Roll and a tiger is shown on the screen. Once they got to California, they were “rubbing shoulders with the greats,” including Snoop Dogg and Dolly Parton. One of them even got married! We see one of the men in black go in for a hug and pop his leg.</p><p>Once their performance was over, we got a clue from Pizza Rat! He flipped over a slice of pizza to show the number “5 billion.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MEDUSA?

Robin and Nicole also felt like it could be the Pentatonix, but Nicole picked up on clues pointing to the cast of Pitch Perfect. Ken predicted the cast of High School Musical is under the mask. But they all agreed that their performance was amazing!</p><p>Online, most fans agreed that it’s the Pentatonix. Some even said they called it “from the first note!” The only other predictions we’ve seen were Big Time Rush and R5.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 9 EXCLUSIVE PREMIERE PHOTOS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the California Roll on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-4f540236-784e-4f7a-a2cc-07e1b50dc01b>Well we hate to say this one is obvious BUT those voices are just so recognizable. So we have to say that the California Roll is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Pentatonix!</h2><p>Let’s be real, you all saw this coming. And here’s how the clues line up!</p><p>A lot of the clues pointed to individual members of the acapella group. California Roll mentioned they’ve “already been on Broadway” and the Pentatonix’s Kirstin Maldonado was in Kinky Boots on Broadway. They mentioned getting a “degree from an Ivy League school,” and Kevin Olusola graduated from Yale. They mentioned being a DJ and Mitch Grassi has a solo moniker as a DJ, Messer. The clue about getting married could be for Kirstin, who got married in 2018, or Matt Sallee, who got married last year.</p><p>Plenty of clues allude to the group as well! The men in black with a popped leg are a reference to pop music, which they sing. The baseball pitch and “perfect” mention are a nod to the group’s cameo in Pitch Perfect 2. They mentioned “gleeful rays” and Kirstin, Mitch, and Scott Hoying entered a radio competition to meet the cast of Glee when they first formed. The map with a red “X” could be pointing to the last letter in the group’s name. And the tiger could be pointing to their victory song on The Sing-Off, “Eye of the Tiger.”</p><p>California Roll mentioned collaborating with Snoop and Dolly, and Pentatonix duet’ed <a href=#>Snoop Dogg’s TikTok singin “I Just Called to Say I Love You”</a> and they also won a Grammy for their “Jolene” collaboration with Dolly Parton. And the final clue, the number 5 billion, is a direct refence to their over 5.9 billion views on YouTube.</p><p>Are you convinced California Roll is the Pentatonix yet?
