Not many people know the real reason why Carrey chose to&nbsp;start comedy&nbsp;— as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, it&nbsp;all began with his mother.</p><p>Let’s take a&nbsp;moment to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know the man behind the longest-spanning character he’s ever played, known as&nbsp;Jim Carrey.</p><p><h2>Jim Carrey had a&nbsp;rough childhood and often recalls trying to&nbsp;lift the mood in&nbsp;the household.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/826/35d/266e675a1ba9161341eccc35c2.jpg><p>Jim Carrey, a&nbsp;Canadian actor, is&nbsp;the youngest of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4</a>&nbsp;siblings. His dad, Percy, was a&nbsp;saxophone player but gave up&nbsp;on&nbsp;his musical career to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;accountant and support his family. His mother, Kathleen, was a&nbsp;stay-at-home mom, and Carrey recalls her not feeling well most of&nbsp;the time as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;suffering from hypochondria, which was observed at&nbsp;every family dinner.</p><p>The actor shared, “I&nbsp;was 7&nbsp;years old and my&nbsp;mom would say things like ’My brain is&nbsp;deteriorating at&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredible rate!’ or ’My angina’s acting&nbsp;up; I&nbsp;could go&nbsp;at&nbsp;any time!’ Things like that would just shake me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the core. It’s terrifying, but <strong>that was her way of&nbsp;getting attention and love.</strong>” That’s when he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;do&nbsp;comedy around the house in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make his mother feel better and happier.</p><p><h2>The actor has always struggled with ADHD and depression.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e43/317/db897e5007a6647bce65f6f973.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ace Ventura</i></a> actor has had a&nbsp;tough time dealing with <a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a> throughout his life; in&nbsp;<a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a>, he&nbsp;was the restless kid that would often interrupt the class.

The actor gladly took the offer and used this quarter of&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;entertain and practice his stand-up <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comedy</a> chops.</p><h2>He&nbsp;dropped out of&nbsp;school at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>16</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;help his parents pay the bills.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/814/8b7/d19c4655ecab1ee773cb73dfd2.jpg><p>Courtesy Everett Collection/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>When Carrey’s father lost his stable job, everything fell apart, and the family of&nbsp;6&nbsp;was homeless and had to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Volkswagen van before ending up&nbsp;sleeping in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tents</a> at&nbsp;various campsites.
