Even the Prime Minister, a friend of Clarkson’s, has said people would be “<a href=#>heartbroken</a>” if Top Gear was taken off air – something that looks likely, as Sunday’s programme will not be shown.</p><p>The British public as a whole are less quick to jump to his defence however, new YouGov research has found.</p><p>45% say that Jeremy Clarkson should be sacked by the BBC for reportedly punching a producer, while 36% say he should not. Most Conservative voters (52%) say he should not be sacked, while most Labour voters (57%) say he should be.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/clarkson1.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Very frequent viewers of Top Gear, unsurprisingly, are firmly opposed (78-9%) to his dismissal, while fairly frequent viewers tend to oppose this by a smaller margin (49-32%).</p><p>Clarkson, who has presented the show since 2002, was given his “final warning” last May after footage <a href=#>appeared to show him using the N-word</a> in a nursery rhyme to decide between two cars. His popularity on YouGov.co.uk has been waning since a year earlier.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/clark.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Half of the British public say that Top Gear should continue with a different presenter if Clarkson is sacked, and 35% say it should not. Those who view the show fairly often agree, by 48-43%, however very frequent viewers would oppose the show being presented by anyone else by 65-28%.</p><p>The Sun newspaper says a source close to Jeremy Clarkson has <a href=#>vouched for his innocence</a>, and <a href=#>quotes a local</a> at the hotel where the fracas went down: “The staff knew the BBC crew were arriving late so they organised meat and cheese platters… Clarkson didn’t like the idea of sandwiches and demanded a juicy steak… Clarkson didn’t hit him [the producer] — but he did use every possible swear word you can imagine”.</p><p>PA images</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpYW19dHnCpZiro6Oku26%2FzJqapGWUmsCmvtWeqmarkZi4</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
