Not only did he shock the national television through his voice, he shared his devastating years of experience in jail. In 2023, he aims to bring back his inspiring story in AGT All-Stars.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-archie-williams-spent-decades-in-jail-for-a-crime-he-didn-t-commit>Archie Williams Spent Decades in Jail for a Crime He Didn’t Commit</h2><p>On April 21, 1983, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Archie Williams</a> was wrongfully accused of raping and stabbing a woman in Louisiana. At the time, no strong evidence would ever tell he’s guilty, but his liberty was nevertheless taken away. Devastatingly, Williams had to suffer the punishment of life imprisonment without possibility of parole.</p><p>To cut the story short, he spent approximately 37 years incarcerated, hopeless that the court would believe his innocence. Throughout his years in jail, music has been his comfort. He joined the prison’s church choir, where he sang his heart out. He also founded his own band with other inmates, finding solace whenever people would come to hear his voice.</p><p>Williams was finally out of jail in 2019. As a compensation for his wrongful incarceration, he became entitled to a maximum of $250,000. Unfortunately, money wasn’t enough for Williams to bring his whole life back. Thus, he sought for another chance to live through America’s Got Talent season 15.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Made Heidi Klum Tear Up During His AGT Audition</h2><p>Williams’ audition consisted of Elton John’s “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me,” which received a standing ovation from the judges and the audience. Judge Heidi Klum, who admitted that she wasn’t a crybaby, teared up by the end of his performance.</p><p>“I felt you, and I’ve been thinking about you and your life. That was very powerful,” she said.</p><p>Williams was automatically sent straight to the Quarterfinals, where he belted Stevie Wonder’s “Love’s In Need of Love Today.” After garnering enough votes for this round, he advanced to the competition’s Semifinals. He captured America’s heart until the AGT’s Finale, ending up in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 10</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Archie Williams Returns for AGT All-Stars</h2><p>While Williams wasn’t hailed as the season 15 winner, but he surely touched and inspired everyone with his journey. Today, he continues to seek justice for innocent people, like him, who are still in jail. As he does, he will attempt to gain another success on television through AGT All-Stars.</p><p>Williams is among the 60 talented acts who will vie for the winning spot in this upcoming AGT spin-off series. To witness how far he’ll go in this competition, tune into NBC on January 30.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_KoreanSoul_Amy-SussmanWireImage-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Alum Korean Soul Signs Deal with Broadcast Music" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>AGT All-Stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRp7CptcRmrqKknJ6urr%2BMrZ%2BeZaenvK%2Bzy7JkoqWgp7a0u82em2armaO0pr6Mq5ytraKjtq%2BzjJ%2Bmq2WRnMFurculZKyskafAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
