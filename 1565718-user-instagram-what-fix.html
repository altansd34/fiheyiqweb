Instagram temporarily disables accounts for various reasons, such as <a id=https://help.instagram.com/366993040048856 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">violating community guidelines</a>, suspicious activity, or reported misuse.</p><p class=align-left>The account becomes inaccessible to the owner and other users during the temporary disablement period. Instagram implemented this security measure to address potential issues or violations. Remember, you can encounter an Instagram "user not found error" but still see the profile picture.</p><h3>2. The account has been permanently banned or suspended</h3><p class=align-left>Instagram's "user not found" error can also be due to the user's account being permanently banned.

The user modified their username</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/df123f5f1f0cc895.jpg><p class=align-left>If an Instagram user has modified their username, searching for their previous username will give you the error.

It is just a glitch</h3><p class=align-left>The error may also occur due to glitches. Technical glitches may occur for various reasons, such as server issues, software bugs, or network problems. In such cases, users might temporarily experience difficulties accessing certain profiles, leading to errors even though the account is active.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d34d4a333af8f890.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unsent Project alternatives: 10 websites you should check out</span></p></a><h3>6.
