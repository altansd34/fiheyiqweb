But there are a&nbsp;few exceptions in&nbsp;which love made everything go&nbsp;faster and a&nbsp;sudden, “Yes, I&nbsp;do” was given in&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;months, weeks, or&nbsp;even just a&nbsp;few hours. Actually, this happens fairly often in&nbsp;the entertainment industry, where celebrities spare no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;fulfill their dream of&nbsp;sharing their life with the person they love.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> looked into which celebrities decided to&nbsp;get married pretty much after they met (for other people’s standards) and this is&nbsp;what we&nbsp;found.</p><p><h2>1. Nikki Reed and Paul McDonald: 7&nbsp;months</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85d/c7a/16999c5750a7a074381adb62d5.jpg><p>This <a href=#>couple</a> met on&nbsp;the red carpet at&nbsp;the premiere of&nbsp;Red Riding Hood in&nbsp;March 2011. And in&nbsp;October of&nbsp;the very same year, they celebrated their wedding, which took place at&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ranch in&nbsp;California in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;about 100&nbsp;people. The day after the wedding, McDonald claimed on&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a> that his wedding day was the most amazing day of&nbsp;his life. Unfortunately, this cute couple <a href=#>divorced</a> in&nbsp;2015.</p><p><h2>2. Katy Perry and Russell Brand: 1&nbsp;year, 1&nbsp;month</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/798/0fc/8bc01157cdb03e5f6c24e2c4da.jpg><p><a href=# title="Katy Perry" data-link=tag>Katy Perry</a> and Russell Brand <a href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;September 2009, and by&nbsp;December of&nbsp;that year, Brand had already proposed to&nbsp;Perry. The wedding ceremony took place in&nbsp;October 2010, in&nbsp;northern India, and was attended only by&nbsp;the couple’s closest friends and relatives. They made sure that there wouldn’t be&nbsp;any interruptions and privacy was their number one priority at&nbsp;all times. They also made sure to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;the region’s landscape and used it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;backdrop for such a&nbsp;great day.</p><p><h2>3. Elsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth: 1&nbsp;year</h2></p><p>Model and actress <a href=#>Elsa Pataky</a> already had other serious relationships under her belt that lasted a&nbsp;few years before she met <a href=# title="Chris Hemsworth" data-link=tag>Chris Hemsworth</a>. But there was something special about him, a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;spark that led her to&nbsp;take the next step, even though they had not been together for more than a&nbsp;year. They actually met at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;2010 and by&nbsp;December&nbsp;25, they were married.</p><p><h2>4. Kaley Cuoco and Ryan Sweeting: 6&nbsp;months</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c45/784/cd8bd550129dfc09a05cb42d62.jpg><p>In&nbsp;September 2013, actress <a href=# title="Kaley Cuoco" data-link=tag>Kaley Cuoco</a> <a href=#>announced</a> her engagement to&nbsp;tennis player Ryan Sweeting, who proposed to&nbsp;her after barely 3&nbsp;months of&nbsp;being together. Another 3&nbsp;months passed before the actual <a href=#>wedding</a> took place in&nbsp;Santa Susana, California. Unfortunately, in&nbsp;2015 Cuoco announced that she was filing for divorce. That was just <a href=#>21&nbsp;months</a> after they got engaged.</p><p><h2>5. Drew Barrymore and Jeremy Thomas: 1&nbsp;month</h2></p><p>They had barely met in&nbsp;1994 when this <a href=#>couple</a> decided to&nbsp;get married on&nbsp;March 20&nbsp;of&nbsp;the same year. Actress <a href=# title="Drew Barrymore" data-link=tag>Drew Barrymore</a> was only 19&nbsp;years old when she fell madly in&nbsp;love with Jeremy Thomas, the owner of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> bar. Unfortunately, the couple didn’t last for more than 2&nbsp;months, after which Barrymore filed for divorce.</p><p><h2>6. Amal Clooney and George Clooney: 14&nbsp;months</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca0/5ad/81c4cf58478c792236f9e98b83.jpg><p><a href=# title="George Clooney" data-link=tag>George Clooney</a> was not only known for being an&nbsp;incredibly talented actor but also for his eternal bachelorhood after his first <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> to&nbsp;<a href=#>Talia Balsam</a> famously failed. But life had other plans for him. In&nbsp;July 2013, he&nbsp;<a href=#>met</a> a&nbsp;lawyer named Amal Alamuddin, and after about 14&nbsp;months into their relationship, they tied the knot in&nbsp;a&nbsp;palazzo in&nbsp;Venice. The actor revealed that they met at&nbsp;his house when he&nbsp;had some friends over to&nbsp;visit. Of&nbsp;course, he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea that his future wife would be&nbsp;there.</p><p><h2>7. Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton: 2&nbsp;months</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c37/390/66c5f75943a06f2cca0ad45370.jpg><p>Although they had already <a href=#>met</a> during the shooting of&nbsp;the 1999 movie Pushing Tin, they didn’t start their romantic relationship until early 2000 because Billy Bob Thornton was dating actress, Laura Dern. They had barely been together for 2&nbsp;months when <a href=# title=Jolie data-link=tag>Jolie</a> and Thronton decided to&nbsp;get married in&nbsp;May of&nbsp;that same year. That, and the fact that both were pretty famous, already turned their relationship into one of&nbsp;the most covered relationships by&nbsp;media back in&nbsp;the day.</p><p><h2>8. Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt: 1&nbsp;year</h2></p><p>This <a href=#>couple</a> started their relationship in&nbsp;June 2018 and announced their engagement in&nbsp;January 2019. 5&nbsp;months later, they were married in&nbsp;Montecito, California.

In&nbsp;August 2020, she and Pratt became parents with the birth of&nbsp;their first daughter, who they named Lyla Maria and they still lead a&nbsp;happy life together.</p><p><h2>9. Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest: 5&nbsp;months</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b4/625/29aacb52608a224c4d74adeba1.jpg><p>This couple’s story is&nbsp;actually sort of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream come true. One day, <a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> saw a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;Christopher Guest in&nbsp;Rolling Stone where he&nbsp;was promoting the movie This Is&nbsp;Spinal Tap. She told the friend she was with that this was the man who would one day become her husband. Finally, in&nbsp;December 1984, her wishes came true. During an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a>, the actress revealed that as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;she saw his picture, she sent him her phone number, but he&nbsp;never called her back. Then, they ran into each other at&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant and the next day he&nbsp;called her. They began a&nbsp;5-month relationship that would eventually lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;long marriage.</p><p><h2>10.

They briefly dated from 1998 to&nbsp;1999 but restarted a&nbsp;romantic relationship in&nbsp;early 2004 after <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a> <a href=#>broke up</a>&nbsp;with her then-partner, Ben Affleck, in&nbsp;January.

They got back together 2&nbsp;years later in&nbsp;May 2018. They confirmed their engagement in&nbsp;July of&nbsp;the same year after only a&nbsp;few months of&nbsp;dating. During the month of&nbsp;November, <a href=# title="Justin Bieber" data-link=tag>Justin Bieber</a> confirmed on&nbsp;social media that they were already married.</p><p><h2>13.
