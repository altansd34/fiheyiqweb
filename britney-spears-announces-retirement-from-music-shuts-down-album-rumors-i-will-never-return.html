Despite rumors of a major comeback album in the works, Spears took to Instagram this week to confirm she is permanently retiring from the industry.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-spears-confirms-her-retirement-from-the-music-industry>Spears Confirms Her Retirement From The Music Industry</h2><p>On Instagram this week, Spears shut down rumors of an upcoming album and confirmed she is permanently retiring from the music industry. The pop star clarified that while she enjoys writing songs in private, she has no interest in releasing new music or touring ever again.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spears</a> bluntly stated that most of the recent news about her has been “trash” and made it crystal clear – she is done with her music career for good.</p><p>“When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people !!! For those of you who have read my book, there’s loads that you don’t know about me…I’ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years !!! I’m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way !!!” Spears wrote.</p><p>Her retirement announcement comes on the heels of reports that Spears was working with hitmakers like Charli XCX and Julia Michaels on a comeback album – her first since 2016’s Glory.</p><p>Sources claimed Spears’ team was trying to “get her excited for the music” and assemble songs to present to her in the studio. However, it seems the Princess of Pop has no interest in recording new music of her own.</p><p>Spears’ last full studio album was 2016’s Glory, which sold just 157,000 copies in the U.S. She briefly returned to music in 2022, collaborating with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elton John</a> on “Hold Me Closer” and will.i.am on “Mind Your Business.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Britney Spears Deactivates Instagram Account After Announcing Retirement from Music Industry – <a href=#>https://t.co/XEBxixAJw9</a></p>— Showbiz 411 (@showbiz411) <a href=#>January 4, 2024</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-reasons-why-britney-spears-ended-her-music-career>Reasons Why Britney Spears Ended Her Music Career</h2><p>For devoted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spears</a> fans, her departure from music shouldn’t come as a total surprise. Since being freed from her 13-year conservatorship last year, she has been outspoken about leaving the industry behind for good.</p><p>She also cited the “awful things” and “wasted time” she endured during her career as reasons for retreating from the spotlight. For now, the pop princess seems content being out of the public eye and having control over when and how she shares her voice. After many years of exploitation, Spears has rightfully earned her privacy.</p><p>While fans will surely miss the iconic voice and catchy songs that defined a generation, they should respect Spears’ choice to leave fame behind. She gave the world so much during her reign as the Princess of Pop.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_RuPaul_Lingo_Guy-LevyCBS-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Best Life Quotes from RuPaul Charles We All Should Live By" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waugraaVrnq0vMSaqaxlkaO7sMHNnJysZaKawaq%2BxKacp6xdm7%2BwuYymrKyhk2LAqcHTrGSdp6ejeqK4wa6kZqqloryzv4yiZLChnKF6r7HVnqlmqpWpwrO6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
