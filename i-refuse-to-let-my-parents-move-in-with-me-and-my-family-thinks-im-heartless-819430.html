For many, this decision is&nbsp;loaded with cultural, emotional, and practical implications, and it&nbsp;can also test the boundaries of&nbsp;<a href=# title="personal space" data-link=tag>personal space</a> and financial stability. That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening to&nbsp;one particular woman.</p><p>I&nbsp;(33F) have been living in&nbsp;my&nbsp;own home for a&nbsp;few years. I&nbsp;bought it&nbsp;with my&nbsp;own money and have worked hard to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;comfortable and safe place after growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very unstable environment. My&nbsp;parents (60s) have always been terrible with money, constantly making poor financial decisions despite my&nbsp;efforts to&nbsp;help them budget.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/494/3ea/f791f056c8be7421c40244156d.jpg><p>I think, I can never earn over which I paid by my precedent employer, but I was wrong, world is so large to try their fate. but now I am making $52/h even more,and easily earn minimum $1300/week, on the experience everyone must try to do work online, easy way to earn, here's an example.<br>ùê∞ùê∞ùê∞.Richnow05</p><p>Recently, they lost their house due to&nbsp;foreclosure. They reached out to&nbsp;me, asking if&nbsp;they could move in&nbsp;temporarily while they get back on&nbsp;their feet. But two additional adults would really stretch the limits of&nbsp;my&nbsp;house, and&nbsp;I value my&nbsp;privacy and independence.</p><p>More importantly, my&nbsp;parents have a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;being overbearing and disrespecting my&nbsp;boundaries. The last time my&nbsp;parents stayed with&nbsp;me, they criticized everything about my&nbsp;lifestyle, rearranged furniture without asking, and even got into an&nbsp;argument with one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;neighbors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77b/01e/a2ae0c581abb4d30ea45dfa1a0.jpg><p>I&nbsp;offered to&nbsp;help them find an&nbsp;affordable rental and even offered to&nbsp;pay their first month of&nbsp;rent. I&nbsp;also found government assistance programs they can apply for. They refused, saying that family should stick together and that it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;duty to&nbsp;help them in&nbsp;their time of&nbsp;need.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42f/fed/87842851a896315bac23e79352.jpg><p>My&nbsp;siblings are divided&nbsp;‚Äî my&nbsp;older brother thinks I‚Äôm heartless, while my&nbsp;younger sister understands my&nbsp;concerns. Both of&nbsp;them live in&nbsp;smaller apartments, so&nbsp;they do&nbsp;not have the option to&nbsp;host my&nbsp;parents.</p><p>My&nbsp;parents have been guilt-tripping me, saying they took care of&nbsp;me&nbsp;growing&nbsp;up, and now it‚Äôs my&nbsp;turn to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;them. My&nbsp;parents are now telling extended family that I‚Äôm abandoning them, and I&nbsp;am getting messages from relatives. It‚Äôs making me&nbsp;second-guess my&nbsp;decision, even though&nbsp;I know my&nbsp;<a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> would suffer if&nbsp;they moved&nbsp;in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8aa/a8b/b27abc58f5a35014db4db22782.jpg><p>You did not chose to be borne, they brought you into the world, so you owe them nothing. I'm 75 years old and I think emotional blackmail is one of the worst things ever. I hope you can resolve this but whatever you decide is your choice and not anyone else's</p><p>Was I&nbsp;wrong for refusing to&nbsp;let my&nbsp;parents move in&nbsp;with me&nbsp;after they lost their house? Should I&nbsp;be more willing to&nbsp;accommodate them, or&nbsp;am&nbsp;I right to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;my&nbsp;own well-being and boundaries?
