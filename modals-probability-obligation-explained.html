Careless use of modals can present a bad first impression, and can even come off as rude, bossy or demanding. No one likes rudeness, so it makes sense to use them correctly. So, what are modals anyway? We will talk about modals of expressing obligation and necessity as well as those to express likelihood and probability.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Introduction to modals in English</h2><p>Modals are a type of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">auxiliary</a>&nbsp;(helping) verb – they work with other verbs to express a range of different meanings. The modal is always followed by a verb in the infinitive form.</p><p>As we will see, using the right modals in the right situation can help us be more specific with what we want to say. They can easily transform a short order into a polite request, for example.</p><p>Let’s look at some of the more common uses for modals – obligation and probability.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Modal verbs to express obligation and necessity</h2><p>We can use&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">modals</a>&nbsp;to express obligation. An&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">obligation</a>&nbsp;is a necessity, or something you have to do. You&nbsp;must&nbsp;remember your partner’s birthday. Remember last year when you forgot? Yeah, you really don’t want that to happen again… When you have no choice in the matter, you can use the modals&nbsp;must&nbsp;or&nbsp;have to&nbsp;in order to express this. We can use each of them in a slightly different way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CR908_modals-graphic-blog_1077x600-1024x532.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Must</h2><p>Must&nbsp;shows an obligation we have no choice about, a strong obligation.</p><p>“I&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;feed the dog before I go out for the evening.”</p><p>You don’t want your poor pooch to go hungry, do you?&nbsp;Must&nbsp;can also be used when you are confident and sure about something happening in the present.</p><p>“The party starts at 10? We&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;leave soon.”</p><p>We can use&nbsp;must&nbsp;to talk in the past tense by adding have.</p><p>“Your friends are laughing? One of them&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;told a good joke!”</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Have</h2><p>Have to&nbsp;can be used to express a more external obligation.</p><p>“I&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;get up at 6 o’ clock to get to work on time.”</p><p>Really, you would rather not, but you have little choice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Modal verbs to express likelihood and probability</h2><p>We can also use modals to express&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">probability</a>&nbsp;(how likely something is to happen) and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">possibility</a>&nbsp;(a chance that something may happen or be true).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Will</h3><p>How likely is something to happen? If you are certain, use&nbsp;will.</p><p>“Your English&nbsp;<strong>will</strong>&nbsp;improve with practise, we have no doubt about that!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Should</h3><p>What if you are quite sure, but not certain? We can use&nbsp;should&nbsp;to say something is likely to occur. If we leave now, we&nbsp;should&nbsp;make it in time. Like&nbsp;must&nbsp;we can talk about the past tense by using&nbsp;should have.</p><p>I was late for the meeting. I really&nbsp;<strong>should</strong>&nbsp;have&nbsp;set my alarm this morning!</p><p>Top tip:&nbsp;Should&nbsp;can also be used to give advice to others.</p><p>“You really&nbsp;<strong>should</strong>&nbsp;go and see you doctor!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Possibility</h3><p>Perhaps you are unsure or uncertain of something happening? Try using the modals&nbsp;could, might,&nbsp;and&nbsp;may.&nbsp;These modals can help us explain that something is possible, but far from guaranteed.</p><p>“If you do a good job, you&nbsp;<strong>could</strong>&nbsp;be in line for a promotion.”</p><p>“Look at those rainclouds – it&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>&nbsp;rain tomorrow.”</p><p>“If you go to the kitchen, there&nbsp;<strong>may</strong>&nbsp;be a piece of cake left… if you’re lucky!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Modal verbs to express ability, permission, requests and assistance</h2><p>The modal verb can also be used to express your ability to do something, asking&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">permission</a>&nbsp;for something, making requests and offering help. You can see that modal verbs cover a lot of roles in our sentences. What useful, hard-working little words!</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Joshua Rhys</h2><p>Joshua is a language teacher, writer, and curriculum designer currently based in Berlin, Germany.
