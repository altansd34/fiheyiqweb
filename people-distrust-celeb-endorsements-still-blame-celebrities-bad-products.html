Young adults, however, are more amenable than Generation X and baby boomers to seeing a superstar hock a product. Thirty percent of millennials said they give some credence to celebrity advertisements, and 18 percent said they trust those spots a lot.</span></p><p>Politicians are trusted even less than celebrities: 32 percent of poll respondents said they have no trust in an ad with a politician endorsing a product, compared with 37 percent who said don’t have much trust in those ads. While the poll&nbsp;doesn’t indicate&nbsp;how people feel about a celebrity-turned-politician endorsement, previous <a href=#>polling</a> showed that people who voted for President Donald Trump tended to&nbsp;follow his preferences on what brands to like.</p><p><a href=#><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/endorsement-mobile.png alt width=1281 height=1476 sizes="(max-width: 1281px) 100vw, 1281px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/endorsement-desktop.png alt width=2616 height=1241 sizes="(max-width: 2616px) 100vw, 2616px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Fyre Festival, which is likely to go down in history as one of the most notorious examples of a failed celebrity promotion, lends credibility to the notion that people don’t trust celebrities know what they’re talking about when they act as endorsers. The April festival was supposed to be a pricey, flashy music event for millennials, but ended up being a struggling camp site that left attendees desperate to be anywhere else.</p><p>While festival organizers Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule have been hit with bad press and <a href=#>lawsuits</a>, it’s influencers and fashion models like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid who promoted the gathering on their social media feeds, giving the impression that the event would be a luxurious escape for ticket holders.</p><p>While a plurality of people — 39 percent — assume a person endorsing a product knows nothing about it and is only appearing in the spot for personal gain, poll respondents also say they hold that person responsible for their pitch.</p><p>Fifty-four percent of adults <span>said they hold the person or organization endorsing a product at least partially responsible for a product not living up to their expectations. But the public still holds product manufacturers to a higher standard, with 83&nbsp;percent placing at least some of the blame on them when a product falls short of expectations.</span></p><p>Fourteen percent of people said they don’t place any blame on the person or organization promoting a product if it doesn’t perform as expected.</p><p>The poll was conducted from May 2 through May 3&nbsp;among 2,225 adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.
