New contestant Fairy dethroned last week’s champion Squirrel, who was unmasked as actress Malin Akerman. Meanwhile, new competitor Jackalope was also unmasked as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social media star Lele Pons</a>.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fairy-dethrones-squirrel-on-the-masked-singer>Fairy Dethrones Squirrel on The Masked Singer</h2><p>Last week, Squirrel became second round’s first champion. She performed again this week, taking on new competitors Fairy and Jackalope. Squirrel sang “Just the Two of Us,” after mentioning that her kid is a fan of the Count from Sesame Street.</p><p>Squirrel also hinted that she had worked with panelist Ken Jeong. When Squirrel was eliminated and forced to unmask, Jeong guessed that she was his Knocked Up co-star Katherine Heigl. However, only Jenny McCarthy correctly guessed that it was Malin Akerman, who appeared with him in Couples Retreat.</p><p>Despite being last week’s champion, Squirrel didn’t even make it into the Battle Royale this week. Both Fairy and Jackalope earned more votes. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fairy impressed</a> with a cover of “You’re No Good” by Linda Ronstadt and made it to next week’s show. The panelists’ guesses included Tracee Ellis Ross and Rashida Jones.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ GUEST PANELIST JENNIFER NETTLES</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jackalope-unmasked-as-lele-pons>Jackalope Unmasked as Lele Pons</h3><p>Wednesday’s episode also introduced us to Jackalope, who showed off an uncanny Shakira impression while singing “Whenever, Wherever.” She also hinted that she had partied with panelist Nicole Scherzinger.</p><p>At the end of the episode, Jackalope and Fairy went head to head in a Battle Royale to “On Top of the World” by Imagine Dragons. Fairy was chosen to move on, while Jackalope was forced to unmask. Scherzinger and Robin Thicke were both correct in guessing that it was Lele Pons. Other guesses from the panel included Jenna Ortega and Camila Cabello.</p><p>Do you agree with the results of this week’s show?
