As&nbsp;tensions rise and the situation unfolds, we&nbsp;are invited to&nbsp;explore the complexities of&nbsp;marital <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a>, personal boundaries, and the fine line between <a href=# title=intuition data-link=tag>intuition</a> and overreaction.</p><p>Me&nbsp;(F27) and my&nbsp;husband (M34) have been married for 3&nbsp;years but were dating 4&nbsp;years prior. He&nbsp;recently got a&nbsp;promotion in&nbsp;his company and moved to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different department. In&nbsp;this department, he&nbsp;recently started interacting with a&nbsp;colleague (F24). I&nbsp;dislike her and have from the start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f4/77b/7157e75ce3a31ae7685673b812.jpg><p>Every time I’m there, she makes sure to&nbsp;call him her work husband. Or&nbsp;she will do&nbsp;simple things such as&nbsp;making him food or&nbsp;giving him extra tight hugs. But my&nbsp;breaking point was last week when he&nbsp;had come home with the food&nbsp;I made him.</p><p>When I&nbsp;asked him why his lunch bag was still full of&nbsp;what&nbsp;I had made him in&nbsp;the morning, he&nbsp;said that she had made him food, and he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;seem rude and waste&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;ignored it&nbsp;till he&nbsp;threw away the food&nbsp;I made him. I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;at&nbsp;6&nbsp;am just to&nbsp;make him his favorite food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c3/674/f05bde5b4797645c57b286103e.jpg><p>But ever since then, this has been happening every day. It’s started to&nbsp;get annoying. Till today, I&nbsp;decided not to&nbsp;make him lunch.</p><p>He&nbsp;came downstairs in&nbsp;the morning to&nbsp;me&nbsp;making breakfast and asked me&nbsp;where his lunch was. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I didn’t make him one because it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;waste anyway. He&nbsp;started arguing that&nbsp;I was being petty over a&nbsp;little thing. But I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;discuss how I&nbsp;felt, and he&nbsp;went over&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>People got on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>“Who is&nbsp;hugging their co-worker in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;their&nbsp;SO (or&nbsp;at&nbsp;all) in&nbsp;the first place?
