However, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the well-wishes, there was considerable attention directed toward Aishwarya’s post-pregnancy weight gain. The actress has openly addressed this issue on&nbsp;multiple occasions and also shared the positive aspect.</p><p><h2>1. Aishwarya Rai didn’t see any issue with her body after giving birth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/87c/c2f/879aee5efc8cf6953e2340c5fa.jpg><p>EAST NEWS<span>, </span>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>During an&nbsp;interview, Aishwarya discussed the issue of&nbsp;body shaming. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “<strong>It&nbsp;was natural in&nbsp;my&nbsp;case</strong>. That was the natural turn that my&nbsp;body took in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;whether&nbsp;I gained weight or&nbsp;I had water retention or&nbsp;whatever else that goes with the space. I&nbsp;was comfortable, and that’s why&nbsp;I have been who&nbsp;I have been.”</p><p>The actress says she made public appearances when it&nbsp;was convenient for her and her baby. If&nbsp;she had considered it&nbsp;a&nbsp;major issue, she would have chosen to&nbsp;stay out of&nbsp;the spotlight or&nbsp;take corrective measures.</p><p><h2>2. People shamed her for the double-chin.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca2/579/279e97554489cee2a212b34267.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf8/a7a/2863645e62958c19392544f06a.jpg><p>Online <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reports</a> extensively covered the emergence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;“double chin” in&nbsp;her appearance, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wave of&nbsp;astonishment among internet users, who were accustomed to&nbsp;seeing their beloved beauty queen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;notably altered form.</p><p>Despite previously garnering praise for her beauty, she faced harsh <strong>criticism for not aligning with societal beauty norms</strong>. Aishwarya endured an&nbsp;extended period of&nbsp;disparaging comments and condemnation. Nevertheless, she resiliently triumphed over the relentless criticism directed her way.</p><p><h2>3. There was a&nbsp;positive side of&nbsp;body shaming.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eaa/fd1/0f798e569c86eedf01b0cdd599.jpg><p>Aishwarya also acknowledged that she knew there were ways to&nbsp;lose weight, but emphasized that it&nbsp;was not her priority. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a>, “<strong>I&nbsp;wasn’t disturbed by&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;people were, well, I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I hope they enjoyed the drama</strong> because&nbsp;I was busy leading a&nbsp;very real life with my&nbsp;baby. I&nbsp;didn’t realize, but&nbsp;I think the most positive thing that came out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;for me&nbsp;was to&nbsp;have so&nbsp;many women come to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and say ’Thank you.’”</p><p><h2>4. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;public figure but also a&nbsp;mother and a&nbsp;woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b1/5b2/5eaf4552efb56e54ae74cbc734.jpg><p>EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Vianney Le Caer/Invision/East News</p><p>Aishwarya didn’t intend&nbsp;to, but inadvertently, embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission by&nbsp;simply being authentic. She demonstrated that <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> and the postpartum period are beautiful yet challenging times, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;disregarding negativity and gossip.</p><p>Above all else, your <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> and well-being should be&nbsp;your top priority. It’s essential to&nbsp;recognize that you are the sole authority when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;determining what makes you comfortable. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world filled with diverse opinions and external pressures, remember that making choices that promote your own physical and <a href=#>mental</a> health should always take precedence.</p><p>Preview photo credit EAST NEWS<span>, </span>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6qv8ewmKuxkWK%2ForWMq5yvnZGhwG60zrBkrKCVYsSiv4ybpp2xXai1ornEnWSanqSav260xKtknZmlnLW1sdGsZJuhoqm1boSQbmxsal8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
