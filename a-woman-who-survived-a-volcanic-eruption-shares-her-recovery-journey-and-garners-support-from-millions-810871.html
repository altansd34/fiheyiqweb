Although left with severe burns and having to&nbsp;deal with the loss of&nbsp;2&nbsp;beloved family members after a&nbsp;volcanic eruption, Browitt realized that giving up&nbsp;was never an&nbsp;option. She went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;share her inspiring recovery journey with millions of&nbsp;people while advocating for other burn survivors.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;2019, Stephanie Coral Browitt went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip that would change both her and her family’s lives forever.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/11e/4ae/469e255f45a52e8e0b2cd47bc9.jpg><p>Originally from Melbourne, Australia, Stephanie Coral Browitt, her sister, and her parents went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;family vacation to&nbsp;<a href=# title="New Zealand" data-link=tag>New Zealand</a>. Browitt, her sister, and her dad went to&nbsp;visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>White Island</a>, while her mom stayed on&nbsp;the boat. Browitt recalls someone shouting for people to&nbsp;“Run!” before the eruption started. “It&nbsp;felt like a&nbsp;wave, like it&nbsp;just takes you,” she said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p><h2>She was one of&nbsp;25&nbsp;people that were rescued after the White Island volcano eruption.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da5/a3a/51f69455b1a43d1040db00a74a.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the eruption, there were 47&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>people</a> on&nbsp;the island, and 22&nbsp;of&nbsp;them, unfortunately, passed away. Browitt, along with other victims, was rescued by&nbsp;volunteer helicopter pilots who risked their own lives to&nbsp;help survivors. Her sister, Krystal, couldn’t be&nbsp;found, and her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dad</a> told the pilots to&nbsp;take his daughter first. He&nbsp;passed away in&nbsp;the hospital a&nbsp;few weeks later.</p><p><h2>She suffered burns over&nbsp;70% percent of&nbsp;her body, including her face.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c7/6f4/71493f5acdbfd497be4abbac62.jpg><p>Not only did the terrible event claim her beloved family members’ lives, Stephanie Coral Browitt was also left with severe burns all over her body. She spent many months in&nbsp;the hospital recovering, including 2&nbsp;weeks in&nbsp;a&nbsp;coma, fighting for her life, while also dealing with grief. “I&nbsp;have learned that the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fight</a> for survival is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real thing... I&nbsp;never knew&nbsp;I had this in&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Browitt decided to&nbsp;document her journey and started posting TikToks about her recovery.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/232/9fd/b8ef745c2c9f61b743594f598d.jpg><p>While undergoing several surgeries and procedures to&nbsp;treat her third-degree burns, Browitt decided to&nbsp;join <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TikTok</a> and start posting about the recovery process. In&nbsp;the short videos, she answered questions people asked her about her treatment, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;shed light on&nbsp;the day-to-day life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;burn survivor. She quickly gained a&nbsp;big following, who cheered her on&nbsp;during these difficult times.</p><p><h2>Her videos about her life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;burn survivor captured the attention of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c88/daa/713dc75ef48745928cd7af3677.jpg><p>When Stephanie Coral Browitt started documenting her recovery journey on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, she was wearing a&nbsp;compression mask that covered most of&nbsp;her face. She was also wearing protective clothing on&nbsp;other parts of&nbsp;her body to&nbsp;help the regeneration of&nbsp;her skin. On&nbsp;her <a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a>, Browitt often answered questions about things like why the garments had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tight</a>, or&nbsp;whether her skin felt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>itchy</a> while wearing them.</p><p><h2>After more than 2&nbsp;years of&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;compression mask, she was finally able to&nbsp;show her face to&nbsp;the world.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acb/d7f/8c0a745f398df400f1806d4296.jpg><p>After 30&nbsp;months of&nbsp;wearing her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>face mask</a>, Browitt was finally able to&nbsp;remove it&nbsp;and show her face to&nbsp;her supporters. “I&nbsp;don’t think I’ll ever be&nbsp;completely satisfied because deep down&nbsp;I really miss how&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;look,” she opened up&nbsp;about her face, admitting that she was scared of&nbsp;people judging her scars. But her followers continued to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her biggest supporters, leaving many encouraging messages after her big reveal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>.</p><p><h2>Today, Stephanie Coral Browitt continues to&nbsp;share her journey and advocates for other burn survivors.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e43/2bc/c337365bf1a759bde3cdd2c306.jpg><p>Although she was able to&nbsp;ditch the compression garments, Browitt’s recovery journey still isn’t over, and she continues to&nbsp;share it&nbsp;with millions of&nbsp;people. At&nbsp;the same time, she is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge advocate for other burn survivors, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>victims</a> who lost their lives in&nbsp;the horrific tragedy. “I&nbsp;do wish my&nbsp;dad and sister were still alive and still with me&nbsp;and that they could be&nbsp;here for this moment. I&nbsp;just hope that&nbsp;I have made them proud of&nbsp;who I’ve become over the past few years. That’s all&nbsp;I can wish for.”</p><p>What part of&nbsp;Stephanie Coral Browitt’s story inspired you the most?
