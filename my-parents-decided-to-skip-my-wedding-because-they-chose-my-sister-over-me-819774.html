This is&nbsp;how years of&nbsp;feeling overlooked culminated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartbreak one man could no&nbsp;longer ignore.</p><p>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;sister who is&nbsp;six years older than&nbsp;me. For years, my&nbsp;parents canceled on&nbsp;me&nbsp;at&nbsp;the last minute because of&nbsp;her.</p><p>I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;basketball <a href=# title=game data-link=tag>game</a>. “Oops, sorry, your sister doesn’t feel like going out.” I&nbsp;was graduating. “Oops, sorry, your sister had a&nbsp;bad day at&nbsp;work.” They missed both major and minor events in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life because of&nbsp;her meltdowns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c3f/1d8/5d9d735f95b9ae9cc5bee657d0.jpg><p>When I&nbsp;met the <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life and we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;tie the knot, I&nbsp;was worried my&nbsp;sister would ruin another special moment. My&nbsp;mom assured me&nbsp;repeatedly that it&nbsp;wouldn’t happen.</p><p>On&nbsp;the day of&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a>, I&nbsp;received a&nbsp;voicemail from my&nbsp;mom saying they couldn’t come because my&nbsp;sister’s dog was sick and she was upset. I&nbsp;was devastated. My&nbsp;best man, however, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;jokester. He&nbsp;took my&nbsp;phone, then went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;fiancée and asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;could post a&nbsp;video of&nbsp;our wedding as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>. She loved the idea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/802/492/17b3b455bead09ac7f23efe3f7.jpg><p>I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea about it&nbsp;until we&nbsp;returned home. Our honeymoon was at&nbsp;a&nbsp;lakeside cabin with no&nbsp;cell service.</p><p>The post’s caption read, “My&nbsp;best friend. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing person, even if&nbsp;his parents NEVER showed up&nbsp;for him.” The video was a&nbsp;slideshow of&nbsp;us with her parents, me&nbsp;on&nbsp;the dance floor, and&nbsp;us cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both sets of&nbsp;parents in&nbsp;wedding pictures, there were only hers. The audio behind the video was my&nbsp;mom’s voicemail explaining why they couldn’t come.</p><p>I&nbsp;came home a&nbsp;week later to&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;messages. <a href=# title=Family data-link=tag>Family</a> members from both sides insisted&nbsp;I take it&nbsp;down. They told me&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister hadn’t stopped crying, and my&nbsp;mom was refusing to&nbsp;leave the house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdb/8f0/6cad13577680bf9679a0ecab4f.jpg><p>Maybe I’m the jerk here. I&nbsp;didn’t take it&nbsp;down when&nbsp;I saw the messages. I&nbsp;didn’t call my&nbsp;family back right away. I&nbsp;waited until my&nbsp;vacation was over and enjoyed my&nbsp;time with my&nbsp;wife in&nbsp;our new home before contacting anyone.</p><p>My&nbsp;dad told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take down the video. He&nbsp;said it&nbsp;was “just a&nbsp;bad night for them” and that they would make it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;wife for not coming. I&nbsp;replied, “How do&nbsp;you plan to ’make up’ my&nbsp;wedding? It’s a&nbsp;once-in-a-lifetime event. You chose to&nbsp;ignore my&nbsp;feelings on&nbsp;the whole matter.”</p><p>He&nbsp;repeated that they would make it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I would take down the video only when he&nbsp;made up&nbsp;for missing my&nbsp;wedding. Frustrated, we&nbsp;both hung up&nbsp;before saying things we&nbsp;shouldn’t have.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;his side.</h2></p><ul><li>“The truth hurts sometimes and your parents &&nbsp;sister just got whammied! Your friend is&nbsp;AWESOME. Please leave the video&nbsp;up!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Unknown user&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Your friend didn’t manipulate their words, your parents would have nothing to&nbsp;cry about if&nbsp;they hadn’t done anything wrong! They skipped your wedding with one seriously pathetic excuse, let them feel the effects of&nbsp;that.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>BellesNoir&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Keep that video up&nbsp;until the end of&nbsp;time. Your parents need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reminded just how much they failed you and favored your sister. Your family doesn’t like&nbsp;it, lucky for you, you just married into a&nbsp;new one.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notsosimpleandsweet&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b8/b31/49b7075701983bec97e541464f.jpg><ul><li>“They were finally called out on&nbsp;their blatant favoritism, and they didn’t take it&nbsp;well. I’d hold off inviting them anywhere or&nbsp;doing anything. At&nbsp;least for a&nbsp;while.<br>Don’t make them your first priority when you aren’t theirs. Focus on&nbsp;your new wife and your awesome best friend. They both sound like keepers!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Pinetree218&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“So, typically, when someone asks you to&nbsp;take down a&nbsp;video of&nbsp;them because it’s embarrassing, you do&nbsp;it&nbsp;because it’s polite. But in&nbsp;this case? They didn’t have a&nbsp;good reason to&nbsp;miss&nbsp;it, and they’re rightfully mortified. They made the bed, they can lie in&nbsp;it.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>NotTwitchy&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It&nbsp;was ’just a&nbsp;bad night,’ out of&nbsp;many, many other ’bad nights’ where they ignored you in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;your sister’s whims. See if&nbsp;your best man can pull up&nbsp;footage of&nbsp;your graduation, and maybe pictures from games they missed, and produce a ’greatest hits’ compilation video to&nbsp;post right next to&nbsp;the wedding video.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>big_bob_c&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>His wedding day, surrounded by&nbsp;friends and his new family, taught him that love and validation can come from those who truly appreciate and respect him.
