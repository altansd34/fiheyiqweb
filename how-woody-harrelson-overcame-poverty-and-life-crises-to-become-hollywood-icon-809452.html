On&nbsp;the other hand, our past doesn’t have to&nbsp;determine who we&nbsp;will become, nor interfere with our dreams and achievements, and Woody Harrelson is&nbsp;living proof of&nbsp;that. In&nbsp;fact, the actor has proven himself to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most talented and versatile actors, but his early life has been anything but typical.<br></p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was troublesome at&nbsp;school and got kicked out many times.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/277/22d/283314547aae3217ee81691b51.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Woodrow Tracy Harrelson</a> was born in&nbsp;Midland, Texas, in&nbsp;1961. His mother was a&nbsp;secretary, and he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;controversial father who abandoned the family when Woody was only 7. However, the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>describes</a> him as&nbsp;“quite a&nbsp;charming fellow,” “a&nbsp;great storyteller” with an&nbsp;“incredible intellect,” but who, unfortunately, went down the wrong path in&nbsp;life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9ca/d8d/2c310b57558f2ffee99d6b244b.png><p>Since his father abandoned the family, he&nbsp;started <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acting out</a> to&nbsp;the point of&nbsp;getting kicked out of&nbsp;nursery school and then out of&nbsp;first grade. Harrison then became a&nbsp;wild child who never shied away from trouble and has been busted more than a&nbsp;few times. However, his troubles really began as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult when he&nbsp;was 21&nbsp;years old, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was arrested</a> for the first time. The incident also made him <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change his mind</a> about his initial dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;cop.<br></p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was poor and anonymous until the age of&nbsp;23.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/572/078/4eb80b57d08b791c2d140da916.jpg><p>Since his father was not around when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;young boy, Woody had to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;resourceful with money to&nbsp;overcome his unfortunate financial situation. As&nbsp;his first job, he&nbsp;bought newspapers in&nbsp;bulk and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sold</a> them around the neighborhood.</p><p>Until he&nbsp;was 23&nbsp;years old, Woody was <a href=# title=poor data-link=tag>poor</a> and anonymous. He&nbsp;took just about any job he&nbsp;could get, like waiting tables and posting gym flyers around local cafes. Until 1985, when he&nbsp;finally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aced the audition</a> for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Cheers</i></a>, making the show his first major gig and his first step on&nbsp;the journey to&nbsp;success.

He&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her about his feelings by&nbsp;writing her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;song</a>, which marked the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;great relationship, and the 2&nbsp;have been inseparable ever since.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;anger and rage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c4/ceb/e475945d6d814e20a7c978d0f1.jpg><p>Harrelson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> to&nbsp;having been unhappy and having a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;anger and rage.

In&nbsp;fact, his loving wife, Laura Louie, whom he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>describes</a> as&nbsp;“the kindest person” he’s ever known, and their 3&nbsp;daughters are probably what made him soften and become the person he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today.</p><p><h2>Today, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;changed person and an&nbsp;advocate for many causes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1da/c0c/8c00c453279b6fe84e32812178.jpg><p>The <i>Zombieland</i> actor <a href=#>has changed</a>, and this happened pretty late in&nbsp;his life. The superstar has been on&nbsp;the screen for over 35&nbsp;years, and his <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> always seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ascending.
