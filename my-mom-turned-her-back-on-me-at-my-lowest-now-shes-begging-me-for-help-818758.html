Honestly, in that situation I wouldn't let the mother live with me either. Too much bad feelings going on. But what I would have done was help her find the local shelters or charitable organizations in the area for her to get the help she needed. Which is more then the mother ever did for her own child.</p><p>Thanks for sharing your story with&nbsp;us, Stephy!

While it’s understandable to&nbsp;feel a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;obligation towards your mother, it’s crucial to&nbsp;prioritize your own mental and emotional health, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;that of&nbsp;your children.</p><p><strong>Politely but firmly <a href=# title=communicate data-link=tag>communicate</a> your boundaries to&nbsp;your mother</strong>, explaining that while you empathize with her situation, you cannot accommodate her request to&nbsp;stay with you.<strong> Offer alternative forms of&nbsp;support, </strong>such as&nbsp;connecting her with local shelters or&nbsp;social services that can provide assistance.</p><p><h2>Seek closure through communication.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/72e/394/3244fd5229aaebb3bc3c236685.jpg><p>Consider initiating a&nbsp;conversation with your mother to&nbsp;express your feelings and seek closure. While it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;challenging to&nbsp;confront her about past actions, <strong>expressing your emotions can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;cathartic step towards healing</strong>.</p><p><strong>Be&nbsp;honest about the <a href=# title=pain data-link=tag>pain</a> her absence caused you and your children, but also try to&nbsp;understand her perspective. </strong>This conversation can provide both of&nbsp;you with an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;acknowledge past mistakes and potentially rebuild your relationship on&nbsp;new terms, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn’t involve her staying with you.</p><p><h2>Focus on&nbsp;self-care.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9d/6fd/ceffa1517e9a43510253c88a3a.jpg><p>Prioritize your own well-being and that of&nbsp;your children during this <a href=# title="emotionally taxing" data-link=tag>emotionally taxing</a> time. <strong>Ensure you’re taking time to&nbsp;rest, recharge, and engage in&nbsp;activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.</strong><br>Consider seeking support from a&nbsp;therapist or&nbsp;counselor who can provide guidance and <strong>help you process your feelings towards your mother’s sudden reappearance</strong>.</p><p>By&nbsp;prioritizing self-care, you’ll be&nbsp;better equipped to&nbsp;handle difficult emotions and make decisions that align with your values and needs.</p><p><h2>Empower yourself through forgiveness.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f0/e62/9e3c3753dab37b9f84933a6adb.jpg><p>Consider forgiveness as<strong>&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful tool for your own emotional liberation</strong>. Forgiveness doesn’t necessarily mean condoning or&nbsp;forgetting your mother’s past actions; rather, <strong>it’s a&nbsp;process of&nbsp;letting go&nbsp;of&nbsp;the anger, resentment, and bitterness that may be&nbsp;holding you back.</strong></p><p>Remember that <strong>forgiveness is&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey,</strong> and it’s okay to&nbsp;take your time and seek support as&nbsp;you navigate through&nbsp;it. As&nbsp;you embrace forgiveness, you reclaim your power and agency, <strong>paving the way for a&nbsp;brighter future for yourself and your children.</strong></p><p>Clarissa is&nbsp;another young woman with a&nbsp;complicated history with her mother.
