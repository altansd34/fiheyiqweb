But it was his appearance on Celebrity Family Feud that took the ratings by storm and left host Steve Harvey unprepared for the fabulousness that ensued. The clash between RuPaul’s team and the cast of Freeform’s The Bold Type turned the game show into a Pride Month extravaganza that had viewers rolling with laughter.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rupaul-made-a-hilarious-guess-that-had-audiences-in-stitches>RuPaul Made A Hilarious Guess That Had Audiences In Stitches</h2><p>RuPaul’s celebrity family for the episode consisted of his longtime friend and Drag Race judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Visage</a>, the original “OG” from Queer Eye For the Straight Guy and fellow Drag Race judge Carson Kressley, two-time Drag Race runner-up Raven, and the beloved fan favorite queen and Miss Congeniality winner, Latrice Royale.</p><p>The hilarity began when RuPaul eagerly hit the buzzer before Harvey could finish the question: “Name a way a woman can flirt with a man without…” But being the seasoned professional that he is, RuPaul anticipated the end of the question, adding his own cheeky twist: “without him thinking that she’s a wh*re.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>This drag humor sailed over Harvey’s head, leaving him visibly horrified. It was reminiscent of the time RuPaul corrected Jimmy Fallon about his proper title. Nevertheless, RuPaul confidently answered his own version of the question, and to everyone’s amusement, he was right on the money, claiming the number one answer.</p><p>Ultimately, the Drag Race team may have lost that particular round to The Bold Type, but they emerged as the true winners overall. They stole the spotlight from the hokey and homophobic host, leaving us wondering why RuPaul hasn’t been invited to headline <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Family Feud</a> more often.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Celebrity Family Feud Ratings Skyrocketed Thanks To Episode Featuring RuPaul</h2><p>The episode featuring the cast of Freeform’s The Bold Type against the cast of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> not only captivated audiences with its entertainment value but also propelled the show to new heights in the ratings.</p><p>Despite a slight dip in the adults 18-49 demographic compared to the previous week, Celebrity Family Feud managed to secure the top spot in Sunday’s primetime ratings once again. The ABC game show delivered an impressive 0.8 rating and drew in a staggering 5.25 million viewers, showcasing the immense popularity of the RuPaul episode.</p><p>It is undeniable that the presence of RuPaul and his crew played a significant role in the meteoric rise of Celebrity Family Feud‘s ratings. Their vibrant personalities, quick wit, and fabulous energy injected a much-needed dose of excitement into the show, attracting viewers from all walks of life. The episode became a must-watch event, drawing in fans of RuPaul’s Drag Race, supporters of LGBTQ+ representation, and anyone who appreciates top-notch entertainment.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_BlakeSheltonGwenStefani_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton Celebrate Their Wedding Anniversary In A Series Of Posts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y6impKGenHqjrcKkZKimXafCsa3UpapmoJmhrrO1zq6qZqyZorJuu81mmp6klZe%2FqsDYZp2apZmhxm6yxK6baA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
