The first movie about Vincent van Gogh, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lust for Life</i></a>, was released in&nbsp;1956, in&nbsp;which the starring role was played by&nbsp;Kirk Douglas. His character is&nbsp;a&nbsp;brilliant but tortured artist. His obsession with art combined with his mental disease makes his life unhappy and full of&nbsp;hardships and failed relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/341/6cb/ddd48755ad962c0d4df58907c8.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2010, the&nbsp;TV movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Painted with Words</i></a>, starring <a href=# title="Benedict Cumberbatch" data-link=tag>Benedict Cumberbatch</a> was released. All of&nbsp;the movie’s dialogue was sourced from van Gogh’s own words. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the film showed&nbsp;us a&nbsp;portrait of&nbsp;a&nbsp;refined, civilized but tortured man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/974/d94/39e8d05db991f150687c654014.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 2018&nbsp;movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>At&nbsp;Eternity’s Gate</i></a>, van Gogh was played by&nbsp;Willem Dafoe.

The first movie was released in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1962</a>, where King Leonidas’s wife was played by&nbsp;Anna Synodinou. This part is&nbsp;rather small, and the queen is&nbsp;depicted as&nbsp;a&nbsp;loyal spouse to&nbsp;the famous king.</p><p>In&nbsp;2006, another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie</a> about the Spartan men entered theaters, where Gorgo was portrayed by&nbsp;Lena Headey. The queen here is&nbsp;much more influential.

Kenneth Branagh directed one of&nbsp;the first movies about this English king, and he&nbsp;also appeared in&nbsp;the starring role. The movie’s title is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Henry&nbsp;V</i></a>, and some viewers believe that this is&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>best</a> film about the king’s life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ac/e40/6a2bde5a31ae29ec88db5f6197.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2012, the story of&nbsp;Henry V&nbsp;was reflected in&nbsp;the fourth episode of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series, <i>The Hollow Crown</i>. The king was portrayed by&nbsp;Tom Hiddleston, and his character is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bold</a> and beautiful.

Charles Laughton, for example, played the king twice, in&nbsp;the 1933&nbsp;movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Private Life of&nbsp;Henry VIII</i></a>, and in&nbsp;the film, <i>Young Bess</i>, which saw the light 20&nbsp;years later. His performance in&nbsp;the first movie even earned him an&nbsp;Oscar. His version of&nbsp;Henry was humane and a&nbsp;bit mischievous.</p><p>British actor Keith Michell also played the infamous king twice, in&nbsp;the series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Six Wives of&nbsp;Henry VIII</i></a> and <i>Elizabeth R</i>. His Henry turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;exactly like we&nbsp;are used to&nbsp;thinking of&nbsp;him, cruel and imperious.</p><p>Eric Bana’s Henry VIII in&nbsp;the 2008&nbsp;movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i></a>, has become one of&nbsp;the most memorable portrayals.

Her story has been adapted to&nbsp;the screen a&nbsp;few times. In&nbsp;the movie, <i>The Brothers Grimm</i>, Báthory was used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>prototype</a> for the evil queen who lured young girls and killed them to&nbsp;stay young. She was played by&nbsp;Monica Bellucci.</p><p>In&nbsp;2008, the movie drama, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Bathory: Countess of&nbsp;Blood</i></a>, starring Anna Friel was released. The moviemakers tried to&nbsp;convey the real historical events and showed Báthory as&nbsp;a&nbsp;noblewoman whose family had great influence in&nbsp;the region where they lived. She became a&nbsp;victim of&nbsp;neighbors’ intrigue, and most evidence against her was fabricated.</p><p><h2>Marguerite de&nbsp;Valois</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea6/8e2/2f8d305496bcd2069c379e2621.jpg><p>The tragic story of&nbsp;the queen was first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adapted</a> to&nbsp;the screen in&nbsp;1944.

She managed to&nbsp;dig deeper into the character, revealing the tragedy of&nbsp;the Queen of&nbsp;Navarre.</p><p><h2>Nikola Tesla</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aec/5a1/a00cc855ccbbe1a60ac49a38a5.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the series, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sanctuary</i></a> (2008-2011), the role of&nbsp;Nikola Tesla was played by&nbsp;Jonathon Young. It’s interesting that Tesla here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;vampire.</p><p>In&nbsp;2020, the biography movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Tesla</i></a>, starring Ethan Hawke was released. The story revolves around the scientist’s inventions.</p><p><h2>Olympias</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b2/03e/477f5f5e75befeba22aa54cfe4.jpg><p>Despite the fact that Alexander the Great’s life was full of&nbsp;fascinating events, there are not that many movies about him. The 2&nbsp;most famous ones are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Alexander the Great</i></a> (1956) and Oliver Stone’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Alexander</i></a> (2004). And one of&nbsp;the main characters in&nbsp;both films is&nbsp;Alexander’s mother, Olympias.</p><p>In&nbsp;the first film, the queen was played by&nbsp;Danielle Darrieux. Her character is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong and charismatic woman who uses her family, her own beauty, and intrigue to&nbsp;rise to&nbsp;power.</p><p>In&nbsp;Oliver Stone’s movie, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) is&nbsp;shown in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar way. She’s a&nbsp;strong and ambitious woman who wants power and uses intrigue and her son to&nbsp;get&nbsp;it. Here, Alexander knows nothing about his mother’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conspiracy</a> against his father, Philip of&nbsp;Macedonia. This way, the director wanted to&nbsp;show that Alexander wasn’t responsible for his father’s death, making Olympias the only culprit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zeceiqq2nop6woriMn6CgraKawG7Dx6hksJ2imnqxu9GtqZqxlZl6o8WMnaCfnpWnsq%2FAjJqaraeiqHqiusNmrp5lk5a7tXnDnpqinJVixKm7jJ2gnWWZqXqjsdOtnKtlaGZ%2BdX%2BQaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
