In 2011, David Cameron launched the National Citizen Service, a shorter, voluntary, scheme that saw young people take part in community projects rather than military service, <a href=#>although participation has been limited</a>.</p><p>Now a new YouGov survey explores what kind of national service – if any – Britons would support.</p><p>We put 12 different variations of a scheme to Britons, varying whether or not the scheme was compulsory; military or civilian (or both); and whether it lasted one month or one year.</p><p>The results show that Britons are more likely to support voluntary schemes than compulsory ones, and support community schemes more than military ones.</p><p>The scheme that most looks like the original national service – compulsory, military, and lasting a year* – comes bottom of the tables. Just 28% of Britons would support such a scheme, compared to 64% who would oppose it. A one month version is equally unpopular, at 29% and 62% respectively.</p><p>No compulsory scheme receives overall support among the public – the most popular is a one month, community-only scheme, but even this is divisive at 45% in favour and 45% opposed.</p><p>By contrast, all voluntary schemes are supported by a majority of Britons. The most popular is the month-long community service only scheme, at 72% (the year long equivalent is similarly popular, at 69%).</p><p>In 2021 in France, Emmanuel Macron instituted <a href=#>a new voluntary scheme</a> which allows participants to spend a month in either military or community settings. The variation from our survey which matches this would be supported by 64% of Britons (an almost identical 65% would back a year-long version).</p><h3>Young Britons are particularly opposed to a year-long, compulsory period of military service</h3><p>Support for all national service schemes is lowest among the age group that would actually have to do them – 18-24 year olds – although there is still net support among this age group for all voluntary schemes.</p><p>Resistance is highest for the year-long compulsory military service, which just 10% of 18-24 year olds would support and 78% would oppose (including 67% who are “strongly” opposed).</p><p>Support increases among every subsequent age group, reaching a maximum of 46% among those aged 65 and above. This generation proves to be split, with an identical 46% saying they would oppose this scheme.</p><p>* national service in the 1940s-60s was typically 18 months; given the expansion of higher education since then, it is likely that a modern version would last closer to a year to fit better with the academic calendar</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGt9dICMnaZmmqKewbC60maumqakYq%2Bztc2gZJuZk6B6r63ToqanmZxiwKa%2B1aKang%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
