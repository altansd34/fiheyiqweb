However, each character is&nbsp;worthy of&nbsp;our respect and admiration. To&nbsp;celebrate our love for cartoons, let’s remember the princesses who taught young girls and adults about leadership, success, and self-confidence. Just check out these 9&nbsp;times Disney princesses were total feminists who challenged beauty standards unexpectedly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e9/d6a/e4c5f65a2ba3f03b2f786b8464.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bianca</a> struggles with body dysmorphia, a&nbsp;<a href=# title="mental illness" data-link=tag>mental illness</a> that causes people to&nbsp;see themselves inaccurately or&nbsp;negatively. But rather than letting her dysmorphia define her, she refocuses on&nbsp;pursuing and accomplishing the things in&nbsp;life that make her feel like enough, for instance, being the talented ballerina she’s meant to&nbsp;be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/595/f90/e9b88151feba41b209aa60d463.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Moana</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Polynesian</a> princess whose story follows her journey to&nbsp;save her people from darkness. This way, Moana’s story is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;many Disney princesses. However, Moana is&nbsp;unique because she takes charge of&nbsp;her own life and does not rely on&nbsp;anyone else to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything for her. She leads by&nbsp;example and proves that young girls can do&nbsp;anything they put their minds&nbsp;to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bac/7be/5c266157e687aac48ea1d29c2d.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Merida</a> is&nbsp;strong, independent, and self-reliant. When forced into marriage for political gain, she refuses the arranged marriage and runs away from home. It’s a&nbsp;message about how she does not want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;told what she has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;please other people. She is&nbsp;her own person who makes her own decisions.</p><p>Merida’s hair is&nbsp;curly, and she doesn’t want to&nbsp;change this. In&nbsp;the past, princesses were expected to&nbsp;“tame” their hair or&nbsp;dress a&nbsp;certain way. However, Merida sees her <a href=# title=curls data-link=tag>curls</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extension of&nbsp;herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94f/ada/28ec3651a3a73611d15dc8d0a2.jpg><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mulan</a>’s father was called to&nbsp;the battlefield, she disguised herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;soldier instead! She impressed the other soldiers by&nbsp;saving their lives with bravery and skill that no&nbsp;man could match.</p><p>With this kind of&nbsp;strength in&nbsp;mind, it’s no&nbsp;wonder why Mulan is&nbsp;such an&nbsp;inspiring figure for women everywhere! She taught&nbsp;us that we&nbsp;could do&nbsp;anything we&nbsp;set our minds to&nbsp;and to&nbsp;never let anyone tell&nbsp;us otherwise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb0/9c5/2e09c3504289e72fd64fe8295f.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mama Odie</a> doesn’t see her blindness as&nbsp;a&nbsp;weakness but rather as&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity for her to&nbsp;learn about the world differently. Her story also shows&nbsp;us that we&nbsp;can overcome obstacles and become more assertive if&nbsp;we&nbsp;have faith in&nbsp;ourselves. This message about overcoming adversity is&nbsp;something that people with disabilities can relate to&nbsp;on&nbsp;many levels, helping them feel more confident about their bodies and abilities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4b/6d2/96bc735934919980b2afeb694e.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Nani Pelekai</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong, independent woman who doesn’t need a&nbsp;man to&nbsp;save her. She’s also not afraid to&nbsp;rock her tummy rolls and show the world that she is&nbsp;no&nbsp;size zero.</p><p>She isn’t ashamed of&nbsp;who she is&nbsp;or&nbsp;her appearance; she doesn’t feel like she has to&nbsp;hide behind layers of&nbsp;clothing because she has some extra weight on&nbsp;her frame. She doesn’t try to&nbsp;cover herself up&nbsp;by&nbsp;wearing baggy clothes or&nbsp;hiding under hats and hoodies. Instead, she embraces her curves by&nbsp;feeling comfortable in&nbsp;her skin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e53/89a/571f875214990df63bad9138e3.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mirabel Madrigal</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl who wears <a href=# title=glasses data-link=tag>glasses</a> and has short curly hair that many young women can relate&nbsp;to. She doesn’t have any special abilities, nor is&nbsp;she adored by&nbsp;everyone. However, she speaks her truth unapologetically. Every day, she proves that we&nbsp;don’t need supernatural powers to&nbsp;save the world.</p><p>While she may not fit the stereotypical definition of&nbsp;a&nbsp;princess, there are still many aspects of&nbsp;her character that one would find in&nbsp;most traditional Disney princesses, such as&nbsp;being kind, loving, and brave.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a0/528/5407ee506c967d52cdb8e6d7c7.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Fairy Mary</a> shatters the stereotype that being overweight makes one clumsy or&nbsp;automatically less athletic. She performs beautiful ice skating routines, exhibiting grace and elegance.<br>Moreover, she’s comfortable with her body and doesn’t attempt to&nbsp;change it&nbsp;whatsoever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90d/69b/d3c86055d4be743330b1cb3d66.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Luisa</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman of&nbsp;many contradictions. She’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>muscular</a> and firm but not masculine. She’s vulnerable and sensitive but not weak. And she’s protective of&nbsp;her own life, her family, and the people she loves.</p><p>But Luisa’s most significant contradiction is&nbsp;that she doesn’t see these things as&nbsp;contradictions in&nbsp;the first place. She’s just herself, plain and simple.</p><p>Which princess do&nbsp;you relate to&nbsp;the most? What are some of&nbsp;the differences between the “old” and “new” Disney princesses that you feel are worth addressing?
