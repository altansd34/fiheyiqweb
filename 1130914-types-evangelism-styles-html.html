One's personality, gifts, and circumstances should be considered when choosing a method.</p><h4>One-on-one or personal evangelism</h4><p class=align-left>Personal evangelism is the most common form of evangelism in the present-day world. It involves talking to someone about Jesus or the gospel in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one-on-one setting</a>. It <a href=#>can</a> be conducted in a formal setting, e.g., during Bible study, or informally, e.g., sharing a testimony with a friend.</p><h4>Mass evangelism</h4><p class=align-left>In this type, spreading the gospel takes place in a large group setting, e.g., a crusade or rally. It usually involves a powerful message designed to reach as many people as possible in a short amount of time. It is sometimes called street evangelism.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/136f580be673714e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yvonne Nelson advises pupils To abstain from sex during school tour; Ghanaians showers praises on her</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/08ccd54acc54356d.jpg><h4>Door-to-door evangelism</h4><p class=align-left>This method involves going door-to-door in your community to share the gospel with others. It is a fantastic way of reaching people who may not have had another chance to spread God's word.</p><h4>Friendship evangelism</h4><p class=align-left>In this approach, one develops relationships or friendships with others. Once the bond is created, they spend time with their friends and share their faith in an organic manner.</p><h4>Media evangelism</h4><p class=align-left>In this approach, a person uses various forms of media to spread the gospel. The most commonly used media platforms are television, radio, and <a href=# title>social media</a>. There are many famous televangelists today, including <a href=#>Chris Oyakhilome</a>, Chris Okotie, David Oyedepo, and T. B. Joshua.</p><h4>Service evangelism</h4><p class=align-left>In service evangelism, one meets others' needs and shows them Christ's love through acts of service, e.g., feeding the needy and volunteering at a local soup kitchen. The gospel is shared as the acts of service are offered.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9e153822173070f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>New York riot erupts as influencer touts game console giveaway</span></p></a><h4>Prison evangelism</h4><p class=align-left>Prison evangelism involves sharing the gospel with inmates.
