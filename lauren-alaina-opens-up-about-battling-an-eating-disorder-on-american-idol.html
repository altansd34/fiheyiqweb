She was just 16 when she appeared on Season 10 of American Idol, calling it her “very awkward, chubby phase.”</p><p>“People commented a lot on my weight… What kind of evil humans can comment on a 16-year-old child is beyond me now. But as that 16-year-old child, it got very bad for a while,” Alaina said, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, adding that she “lost who I was completely.”</p><p>Alaina recalled a blog adding a pig nose to her photo and calling her “Miss Piggy.” The singer said that while she’s always been confident performing on stage, she’s never felt confident about her weight. Even as she finished Idol in second place, she continued to struggle.</p><p>“It was an extreme high and an extreme low and I got sick… I struggled very, very bad with bulimia for a very long time,” Alaina shared. She eventually sought out-patient treatment for the issue.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LAUREN ALAINA TO APPEAR AS SPECIAL GUEST ON PENTATONIX WORLD TOUR</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dwts-prompted-alaina-to-return-to-therapy>DWTS Prompted Alaina to Return to Therapy</h3><p>Alaina competed on Season 28 of Dancing with the Stars in 2019. She shared that although she “had been in complete remission for years” for her eating disorder, the prospect of appearing on television again prompted her to return to therapy.</p><p>“I immediately was like, I gotta call the therapist. I gotta call her, and get in there, because I can’t let myself get back to that place again,” Alaina told Brown. “And it would have happened, probably. Most likely. If I had not addressed it and asked for help.”</p><p>Alaina is currently joining Pentatonix on tour, and she recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released an EP called Unlocked</a>. Last month, the 28-year-old put out a new single called “Just Wanna Know That You Love Me.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AGT-Season-18-judges1-220x146.jpg alt="Some ‘AGT’ Fans Think It’s Time to Change Up the Judging Panel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Lauren Alaina</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y5qsq52eYq6trcinmGanoJq7tHnUqWSamp%2BqwW6uwK2rpaGenHqiuoyemK2hnpx6pbXSqKmdnaJivK95wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
