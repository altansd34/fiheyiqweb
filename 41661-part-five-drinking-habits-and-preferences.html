Specifically, we looked at how many glasses of tea, coffee, tap/bottled water, smoothies, milk, fizzy drinks and fruit juice Britons drink in a typical week.</p><h3>Drinking water, smoothies, milk, fizzy drinks and fruit juice</h3><p>One in six Britons (15%) do not drink tap water, with this going to 19% among those 60 or older. Two-thirds (66%) don’t drink bottled water.</p><p>Smoothies are most popular with the younger generation – a quarter (25%) of those aged 16-24 have at least one smoothie a week, with this falling to 7% of those aged 60 or older.</p><p>Results also show that half of Britons don’t drink milk (50%) and 44% don’t typically drink fizzy drinks or fruit juice.</p><h3>How much tea do Britons drink?</h3><p>Three quarters of Britons (74%) drink a cup of tea at least once a week, the study finds. This includes 17% who say they have more than 20 cups over the course of the week.</p><p>A quarter of Britons (25%) don’t drink tea at all. This goes up to one in four (39%) among 16-24-year-olds.</p><p>The older Britons are, the more likely they are to drink considerably more tea – 20 cups or more – a week (24% of those aged 60+ vs 6% of those aged 16-24).</p><p>Three-quarters of tea-drinking Britons (74%) don’t take any sugar with it, with this applying more to women (78%) than men (69%). Among those who do put sugar in their tea, 14% have one teaspoon and 10% have two.</p><p>The older Britons get, the less likely they are to take sugar with their tea: from 50% among 16-24-year-olds to 83% among those 60 and older.</p><p><strong>How much coffee do Britons drink?</strong></p><p>Seven in ten Britons (70%) drink coffee at least once a week, with one in eight (12%) having more than 20 cups a week.</p><p>One in three Britons (29%) don’t drink coffee. Among Britons aged 16-24, half (52%) don’t drink coffee, while this applies to a third (33%) of 25-39-year-olds, 27% of those aged 40-59, and 16% of those aged 60+.</p><p>Seven out of ten Britons (70%) who drink coffee take it without any sugar. The older Britons are, the more likely they are to have their coffee without sugar – from 43% among 16-24-year-olds to 79% in the oldest generation.</p><p>One in six (17%) Britons have one teaspoon of sugar with their coffee, and 10% have two.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsYWuDcnnPmqmtZZaew6Z5w6ugp6OZo7RutMCboK2rXZa7pXnPq5yfnaKau6Sx0g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
