Among Leave voters his lead is 87% to 9%, and although among Remain voters he comes behind Corbyn it is not as far behind as he might have worried at 39% to 45%.</p><p>Corbyn for his part was keen to play on safe Labour ground of defending the NHS, and he too will be pleased to see this rewarded by the audience. By 54% to 38% the Labour leader was seen as being better on the NHS.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/ITV20debate20topics-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Most viewers come away from the debate feeling frustrated</strong></h4><p>Nevertheless, the abiding emotion emanating from the audience is one of frustration. With both leaders avoiding answers on key questions, fully 58% of viewers chose the word “frustrating” when asked to choose up to three words to describe the debate.</p><p>Slightly more hearteningly the second most common sentiment was that the debate was “interesting” (45%), followed by “engaging” on 35%.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/ITV20debate20words20to20describe20debate-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong><a href=#>See the full results here</a></strong></p><p>A preliminary survey published this morning showed that the public expected Boris Johnson to perform better by 37% to Jeremy Corbyn's 23%.
