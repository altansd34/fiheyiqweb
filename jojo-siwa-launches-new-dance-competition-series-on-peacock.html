As if she isn’t already busy enough with <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, she has now announced that she will be creating the next big girl group phenomenon on Peacock. This is absolutely insane considering this 18 year-old also begins her <a href=#>upcoming concert series</a> in January.</strong></p><p>Siwa announced that she and her mom will be creating a new dance competition show. This show will be exclusively streamed on Peacock beginning November 4. Siwa’s Dance pop Revolution seems to be a mix of a singing and dancing competition show for young females.</p><p>At first glance, I could see ties to World of Dance. But, we won’t know if the formatting is similar until the show actually premieres. The powerhouse family dynamics of this show shouldn’t surprise anyone since both JoJo Siwa and Jessalynn Siwa were seen on Dance Moms.</p><p>As some may already know, Siwa’s mom owned a dance studio while JoJo was on Dance Moms. Since both Siwas have a background in dance, they’re bringing a lot of knowledge to the plate. I’m really interested to see how this show does.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-says-her-bows-are-on-vacation>JoJo Siwa Says Her Bows are ‘On Vacation’</h2><p>The new show was announced just a day after Siwa went on <a href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> to talk about Dancing With the Stars, the absence of her iconic bow, and everything in between. Siwa showed up to the show with a braided half-up half-down pigtail look. This is not the iconic look we know and love out of the dancer. Within the interview she acknowledged her current pause from the bows.</p><p>“I love my bow and I always will, and it’s a piece of my life, but I’ve had a lot of fun exploring with my hair,” said Siwa. “Every day I do something different.”</p><p>Siwa was seen glowing as soon as she sat down across from Clarkson, and I’m not just talking about the glitter in her hair. The dancer looked genuinely happy when talking to Clarkson on the show.</p><p>It’s no secret that Siwa is most known for her role in the popular series, Dance Moms. Since she was on Dance Moms, some may think she has the upper hand on DWTS, but that’s not true at all. Even though she’s a dancer, she wasn’t trained in ballroom dancing.</p><p>She described her experience as a football player playing soccer and how they wouldn’t intentionally play the sport because it’s not their thing. The form of dance she is used to is mostly cardio, whereas this new form she’s learning involves cardio and muscular endurance.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1088607822.jpg alt="Ryan Seacrest’s ‘New Year’s Rockin’ Eve’ Will Feature First-Ever Spanish Countdown" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiecuarKebmJrAbrrEsGSdmZ6Ysm6vzqannqyZqbawuoysnKuhlah6sLqMqZyam5%2BYuHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
