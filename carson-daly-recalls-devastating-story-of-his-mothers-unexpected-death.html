His mother ended up passing away of a heart attack four hours later. Daly was woken up by a call from his sister, and he initially thought it was about their stepfather.</p><p>Daly shared his <a href=#>final text exchange</a> with his mother, in which she calls him “the best son on the planet earth” and thanks him for “all you did and do to make our lives better and to make us so proud of you.”</p><p>“I’m so grateful that I have this last exchange to look at,” Daly wrote. “You can feel her love in her words (and emojis).”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CT7SGCdAz5Z/?utm_medium=copy_link</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>CARSON DALY SPILLS DETAILS ABOUT BLAKE SHELTON’S TEARFUL WEDDING SONG FOR GWEN STEFANI</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daly-s-stepfather-passed-away-not-long-after-his-mom>Daly’s Stepfather Passed Away Not Long After His Mom</h3><p>Daly shared that his stepfather sadly passed away six weeks after his mother. His sister Quinn moved across the country with her family so that they could live a few blocks apart.
