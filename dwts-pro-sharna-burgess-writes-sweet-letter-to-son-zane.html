She and her partner Brian Austin Green <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcomed their baby boy</a> in 2022.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sharna-burgess-posts-adorable-message-for-her-baby-boy>Sharna Burgess Posts Adorable Message for Her Baby Boy</h2><p>In a recently uploaded video on Instagram, Burgess looked back at a moment where she was still pregnant with Zane and showed how much he has grown since then. According to the DWTS pro, she’s <a href=#>proven herself wrong</a> when she thought she couldn’t love her son more and more.</p><p>“My Mr Man, my beautiful babbling giggly and very opinionated boy,” she wrote. “You wanna know something I am so certain of now that I have brought a life into this world? It’s that they turn up who they are already. Their isms, quirks, personality … it’s a part of the soul that lives within the body.”</p><p>While Burgess recognizes that no parent is perfect, she believes that they must guide their children as they form their own beliefs. The dancer also noted that her role should be to create a “safe loving environment” that’s meant to nurture Zane.</p><p>“All we can do is our best, to not control or create or change them, but to understand they are the writer director and star of their own movie and we are simply their supporting role,” she wrote.</p><p>She ended her post by claiming that being a mom is “by far the greatest most rewarding job” ever. At present, Burgess <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">assumes the role of a mother to Green’s three sons</a> with Megan Fox.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Recently Shared a Motherhood Update</h2><p>Before Christmas, the DWTS pro shared an update about her breastfeeding journey. She posted a series of photos that she’s taken when she’s feeding milk to Zane.</p><p>“My supply seems to be slowing so much even though I’m doing all the things,” she wrote. “I’ll be so sad when I can’t nurse him anymore and at the same time happy to have my boobs be mine again.”</p><p>Moreover, Burgess stated that the six-month-old Zane is now babbling and eating food. As mentioned by the dancer, her baby boy resonates well with his zodiac sign, Cancer. Particularly, Zane is emotional, sensitive and needs love at all times.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_JenniferLopez_Emma-McIntyreGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Jennifer Lopez Calls Marrying Ben Affleck an ‘Emotional Transition’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuv8eaqaeZXZfCs7PErKpmr6Kewaa%2FjKyunp2kYrmmwNOeqWasn2LAsLqMs5innV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
