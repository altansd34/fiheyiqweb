Many artists have used them in&nbsp;their works as&nbsp;inspiration or&nbsp;as&nbsp;the subject matter because of&nbsp;their strong association with freedom and their representation of&nbsp;nature’s beauty. Due to&nbsp;their nature, they symbolize change and the positive outcomes that can occur. Our subconscious mind, however, <a href=#>symbolizes</a> butterflies in&nbsp;many different ways. It&nbsp;analyzes their colors, shapes, and compositions without&nbsp;us realizing what it&nbsp;means.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we’ve created a&nbsp;fun personality test to&nbsp;see what kind of&nbsp;person you are based on&nbsp;the butterfly you choose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3c/e38/05fbd55eff9db877e00c2d32b0.jpg><p><h2>1.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/411/47a/0c968859aeae33c61c7e20cfe2.jpg><p><strong>You’re sensitive and honest.</strong></p><p>If&nbsp;you’ve chosen this beauty, it&nbsp;means you’re sensitive, honest, and very romantic. You show a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;compassion to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people, even to&nbsp;those you don’t know, because you regularly put yourself in&nbsp;other people’s shoes. You’re very emotional and you always care for other people’s needs and feelings&nbsp;— so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that you neglect your own feelings at&nbsp;times.</p><p>Helping other people is&nbsp;in&nbsp;your nature and you rush to&nbsp;someone’s “rescue” right away. However, you should always take care of&nbsp;yourself first since sharing your feelings is&nbsp;something that you struggle with. Not because you don’t want&nbsp;to, but because you feel that you are burdening others. You should always keep in&nbsp;mind that your problems are as&nbsp;important as&nbsp;other people’s problems and you should treat yourself just as&nbsp;beautifully and kindly as&nbsp;you treat others.</p><p><h2>2.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d8/89f/b41fae53788a6c79adf607f319.jpg><p><strong>You’re peaceful.</strong></p><p>If&nbsp;you chose this butterfly it&nbsp;means that you are a&nbsp;peaceful and harmonious person. You have a&nbsp;very calm character and a&nbsp;down to&nbsp;earth personality. One word that can define you is&nbsp;“balance” and you try to&nbsp;apply it&nbsp;in&nbsp;every aspect of&nbsp;your life. You believe keeping balance between your personal life and your professional life is&nbsp;ideal for your mental health. You deeply believe that the perfect balance is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;happiness.</p><p>You can easily panic when you face an&nbsp;unpleasant situation and you lose faith quite easily without really admitting&nbsp;it. People around you can’t really see that since you prefer to&nbsp;hide your feelings and distance yourself until you deal with your own problems.</p><p><h2>3.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/574/de6/0f22065e6592e43d4b7eb34657.jpg><p><strong>You’re a&nbsp;creative soul.</strong></p><p>You are the type of&nbsp;person who sees beauty in&nbsp;everything. While many people might just see a&nbsp;flower, you see an&nbsp;entire universe through&nbsp;it. You like to&nbsp;analyze everything even when you don’t have&nbsp;to. Analyzing things is&nbsp;your way of&nbsp;understanding life. This also makes you a&nbsp;very <a href=# title=logical data-link=tag>logical</a> person and most people see you as&nbsp;very mature.</p><p>At&nbsp;your job, you like perfection and you’d rather miss a&nbsp;deadline than deliver something average on&nbsp;time. This can make you a&nbsp;workaholic but it&nbsp;doesn’t bother you because you love what you do&nbsp;for work. You find joy in&nbsp;small things which means the world to&nbsp;you and you try to&nbsp;show that to&nbsp;others who struggle to&nbsp;understand you.</p><p><h2>4.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce4/969/af1e84589a8b290615c51ad702.jpg><p><strong>You’re ambitious.</strong></p><p>In&nbsp;school, people described you as&nbsp;the person who’d be&nbsp;the most successful. Not necessarily someone who would become a&nbsp;millionaire but someone who is&nbsp;ambitious, organized and achieves their goals. You believe you have a&nbsp;purpose and you’re set to&nbsp;find it&nbsp;and excel at&nbsp;it&nbsp;because that defines your personality. You don’t like laziness and you associate yourself with hardworking people because that is&nbsp;what you can relate&nbsp;to. You like to&nbsp;feel safe and it&nbsp;sometimes makes you afraid of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Failure is&nbsp;your greatest fear but through your work, you always prove to&nbsp;yourself that you are one step closer to&nbsp;your goal. Sometimes you leave your personal life aside but at&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;your mind you quickly feel guilty and try to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the people you love as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you realize. That’s because you deeply believe that you can only share your success when you have the people you love by&nbsp;your side.</p><p><h2>5.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e41/088/5f902f53a68258818051029980.jpg><p><strong>You’re enthusiastic.</strong></p><p>If&nbsp;you’ve chosen this butterfly it&nbsp;means that you are a&nbsp;bubbly and enthusiastic individual. You find joy in&nbsp;everything you do&nbsp;and you always see the bright side in&nbsp;every situation. Your dream and purpose in&nbsp;life is&nbsp;to&nbsp;gather as&nbsp;many experiences as&nbsp;you can because you believe this is&nbsp;the true meaning of&nbsp;life. One of&nbsp;your greatest fears is&nbsp;boredom.</p><p>You believe boredom is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mental prison and being trapped in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;place while the whole world is&nbsp;waiting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;discovered by&nbsp;you is&nbsp;the worst thing that could happen to&nbsp;you since life is&nbsp;so&nbsp;small and beautiful. Even though you manage to&nbsp;get things done at&nbsp;the right time, most of&nbsp;the time you struggle with meeting deadlines. You try to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;things all at&nbsp;once, thus causing you to&nbsp;lose focus and not be&nbsp;productive in&nbsp;the end since your enthusiasm gets in&nbsp;the way. But since this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge part of&nbsp;your character, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;something that makes you stand out and you should accept it&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;change&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>6.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5db/296/f6fe455d3389ba9fff1e35e794.jpg><p><strong>You’re a&nbsp;logical person:</strong></p><p>If&nbsp;you’ve chosen this beautiful butterfly, it&nbsp;means that you’re a&nbsp;very logical and wise person. People around you always come to&nbsp;you for honest and constructive advice or&nbsp;criticism because you know how to&nbsp;separate your emotions from a&nbsp;situation. You don’t let yourself get emotionally involved in&nbsp;any incidents because you believe that will prevent you from seeing what’s right and what’s wrong. Furthermore, you put morality above all. You always strive to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the right thing because having a&nbsp;clean conscious is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the things you value the most.</p><p>Which butterfly did you choose?
