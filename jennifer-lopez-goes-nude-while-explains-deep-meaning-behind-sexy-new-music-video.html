She also explained the true meaning behind the song that is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">now available on Triller.</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-deep-meaning-behind-jennifer-lopez-s-seductive-new-music-video>The Deep Meaning Behind Jennifer Lopez’s Seductive New Music Video</h2><p>“The song is really about demanding someone to treat you in the right way,” Jennifer said during a look at the making of the video. “There is a lot of symbolism in the video. This girl kind of falls into a relationship and she is sinking in this water and so she grows a mermaid tail and she grows up and then little by little she starts growing her own wings just to be able to walk away from the relationship.” JLo is currently engaged to MLB star Alex Rodriguez after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first meeting in 2005</a> and reconnecting years later</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>JENNIFER LOPEZ & ALEX RODRIGUEZ PLAN WEDDING IN THIS COUNTRY WITH HIGH CORONAVIRUS CASES</a></strong></p><p>She first performed the song “In The Morning” during Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve broadcast. Alex was there to support her and was dancing to her performance along with their children. The former American Idol judge also posted a teaser of the music video on Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ_V3BYpK9b/</p></figure><p>“And she loved a boy even more than she loved herself…I am soooo excited for you to see the official video for&nbsp;#InTheMorning” she captioned the post. “It’s full of symbolism about a dark one-sided relationship and the realization that you can’t change anyone else … you can only change yourself!!! Grow your own wings and walk away from anyone or anything that doesn’t truly value all you have to offer.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-goes-fully-nude-in-the-music-video>Jennifer Goes Fully Nude In The Music Video</h3><p>In the music video, she transforms into quite a few mythical creatures. At the beginning of the video, the songstress is wearing a pastel-colored wig as she floats in the water. Then, she sprouts a mermaid tail. JLo sheds a few tears in the video before sprouting angel wings without any clothes on. She also wears a gorgeous white wrap dress and the same white-feathered outfit she wore on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>The video finishes with a silhouette of Jennifer’s body with fully sprouted angel wings as the screen fades to black.
