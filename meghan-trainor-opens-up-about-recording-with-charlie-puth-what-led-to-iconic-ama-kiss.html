First, she looked back at their iconic American Music Awards kiss, now she’s talking about the creation of their 2015 duet “Marvin Gaye.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meghan Trainor Admits She Made Out With Charlie Puth After Recording “Marvin Gaye”</h2><p>In 2023, Trainor is a happily married musician, that’s enjoying <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">looking back at her past</a>. After poking fun at her 2015 award show kiss with Charlie Puth, Trainor has once again returned to the subject. During a recent appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Trainor revealed that during the American Music Awards was not the only time she kissed Puth.</p><p>During a block of fan-submitted questions, a curious fan asked about Trainor’s time spent with Puth. The question was: “since your makeout with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Puth</a> at the AMAs was such a viral moment, did you ever make out with him at a time when the cameras weren’t rolling?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll give you tea,” Trainor replied. “The day we recorded ‘Marvin Gaye’ — very, like, romantic song — there was booze, and we made out that night in the studio.”</p><p>She then admitted that it never happened again after the AMA performance. Apparently, the mix of the romance song and liquor made both singers feel something. Puth has yet to speak about this blast to the past.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-met-her-now-husband-soon-after-the-viral-kiss>She Met Her Now-Husband Soon After The Viral Kiss</h2><p>Soon after Trainor publicly made out with Puth at the AMAs, she met her current day husband, Daryl Sabara. In 2016, Trainor went on a double date with Sabara, claiming it was “love at first sight.”</p><p>Trainor and Sabara wed in 2018 and welcomed their first child in February 2021. The singer is currently carrying their second child. Recently, they had their gender reveal on The Kelly Clarkson Show. On the show, they announced that they’re expecting another boy.</p><p>In modern day, it’s obvious that Trainor is very happy with her little family. These past months, she’s clearly had a bunch of fun looking back at this viral moment. In September 2022, the singer uploaded a TikTok video about the 2015 kiss.</p><p>In the 15-second video clip, the “Title” singer reminisced about “‘All About That Bass’ hitting #1 in 2014” and wobbled, implying her pleased reaction. Trainor then twerked after the “winning a Grammy in 2016′ text flashed on screen.</p><p>However, after the text transitioned into “making the decision to kiss Charlie Puth on national television in 2015,” Trainor refused to dance nor display a delighted response. This was completely different from the happy dances she exhibited in the first seconds of the clip. It seems though that the singer has reflected on the moment and realized it was a not-so-awesome memory.</p><a title=@meghantrainor href=# rel=noopener>@meghantrainor</a> It was a wild 3 years <a title=grammys href=# rel=noopener>#grammys</a> <a title=allaboutthatbass href=# rel=noopener>#allaboutthatbass</a> <a title=amas href=# rel=noopener>#amas</a> <a title="♬ Hal Walker Plays the Banakulas - Hal Walker" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Hal Walker Plays the Banakulas – Hal Walker</a><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_TaylorSwift_Terence-RushinTAS23Getty-Images-for-TAS-Rights-Management-220x147.jpeg alt="Taylor Swift Rumored to Be Dating The 1975’s Matty Healy After Joe Alwyn Split" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>charlie puth</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Meghan Trainor</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6eoZmeYsGzrcinpqtln6Wyr7%2BMrqdmmZKkwrV50Z6aqKqUnruoedaiq6Flk52us7jInmSpraSderi0wK1kpZ2UYsGwecicpqehk2Kurq2MpKCsq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
