Meanwhile, Ryley Tate Wilson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">turned all four coaches’ chairs</a> with his rendition of Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own.” He chose to join Team Niall.</p><p>Now the two singers are competing in the Battle round, performing a duet of “Heartbreak Anniversary” by Giveon. It was a four-chair turn against a one-chair turn, and a 29-year-old against a 15-year-old, but both singers totally held their own during the soulful performance.</p><p>“That was crazy,” coach Kelly Clarkson said as she gave the pair a standing ovation. Chance the Rapper agreed, calling it “insane” and “one of the best performances that we’ve seen in the Battle round so far.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE’ SEASON 23 INTRODUCES THE PLAYOFF PASS, WILL IT MAKE OR BREAK CONTESTANTS?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-the-coaches-think-of-their-performance>What Did the Coaches Think of Their Performance?</h3><p>“It was incredible how you guys bounced off of each other,” Chance told the two singers. “I loved the arrangement, I loved the lyric splits that you guys did. You guys both have so much control, and Ryley, you’re only 15? That’s crazy.”</p><p>He also said that Michael “killed that” and added that he would choose him as the winner. Meanwhile, Clarkson told Michael that she didn’t know “why you weren’t a four-chair turn.” Blake Shelton chimed in to say, “I don’t think I was there that day.” Clarkson said both singers “should be in the finale.”</p><p>When it came time for Horan to make his decision about a winner, he joked, “If they ask me to come back, I’m not coming back, because I cannot tell you how hard this is.”</p><p>We’ll find out which artist Horan chose to keep on his team when The Voice Season 23 returns Monday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_MillieBobbyBrown_Arturo-HolmesWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="‘Stranger Things’ Star Millie Bobby Brown To Release Debut Novel “Nineteen Steps”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57056YpmWenq6tuIymnKaalafAbrDEpaCvnaJiwLDBy5%2BspWWSlsG1uMRmoKdlpJ2ybsLOopqeZZWWv63FjKucpZ2RqLJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
