I’m talking about works from Da&nbsp;<a href=# title=Vinci data-link=tag>Vinci</a>, Michelangelo, Picasso. Grab your magnifying glass as&nbsp;this journey is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;begin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ce3/466/7e50085b0b916591469541dd5c.png><p>First off on&nbsp;your list is&nbsp;Rome. After enjoying delicious pasta, you head to&nbsp;the Sistine Chapel&nbsp;— home to&nbsp;the world’s most famous ceiling. Oh, and you know how they say Michelangelo painted the frescoes lying down. This is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;myth! Actually, the painter created a&nbsp;complex system of&nbsp;platforms that allowed him to&nbsp;paint standing.</p><p>You’re checking out the Creation of&nbsp;Adam: that fresco in&nbsp;the middle. The Italian artist Michelangelo, the author of&nbsp;this masterpiece, was widely known for his study of&nbsp;human anatomy. Art experts argue that the right part of&nbsp;the painting is&nbsp;an&nbsp;anatomically correct depiction of&nbsp;an&nbsp;enlarged <a href=# title=brain data-link=tag>brain</a>. To&nbsp;proof-check this, you try overlapping a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;the organ and the artwork.</p><p>It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;match: the cerebellum, the optic nerve, and the pituitary gland are all there. Even the floating green scarf thingy appears to&nbsp;match the vertebral artery. Some researchers think it&nbsp;was Michelangelo’s way of&nbsp;depicting knowledge and wisdom, but you must sleep on&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;decide what you think.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/932/6d8/5d98ba512fb22f2644ecbabc89.png><p>Moving&nbsp;on, you catch a&nbsp;train and arrive in&nbsp;Florence! Time for a&nbsp;quick gelato break, then straight to&nbsp;the Accademia Gallery. One of&nbsp;art’s most celebrated sculptures is&nbsp;waiting for you inside: Michelangelo’s David.</p><p>David is&nbsp;a&nbsp;17&nbsp;ft tall marble wonder. It&nbsp;was carved for about three years. The mystery surrounding it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;figure out the statue’s true expression. Looking at&nbsp;him from below, you’ll think his face is&nbsp;serene and peaceful. But art historians argue that this work was largely misunderstood. Apparently, his body hides a&nbsp;very different story!</p><p>Take a&nbsp;closer look, and you’ll notice his brows are frowning, and the veins in&nbsp;his arms are popping out. That doesn’t look too relaxed, does&nbsp;it? Michelangelo’s idea was to&nbsp;depict David right before an&nbsp;important confrontation, so&nbsp;maybe he&nbsp;wasn’t all that serene after all. Italy is&nbsp;so&nbsp;rich in&nbsp;art, you can’t leave just yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/af1/43d/ba1d6e5f16937413e3703de563.png><p>You are still in&nbsp;Florence. You pay a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;the famous Uffizi Gallery. Many famous paintings are hosted by&nbsp;this museum, but you’re checking out Botticelli’s Primavera... or&nbsp;“Spring”. This artwork is&nbsp;mysterious from the get-go: experts can’t say the exact year it&nbsp;was commissioned. It&nbsp;remained untitled for years until the painter Giorgio Vasari finally came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;name for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Usually, when critics and viewers admire this painting, they focus on&nbsp;the figures in&nbsp;the foreground. But in&nbsp;this case, the actual work lies in&nbsp;that Botticelli painted over 46&nbsp;different plant species with almost identical precision. And&nbsp;oh, in&nbsp;the painting overall, these plant figures are repeated over 200&nbsp;times. Unbelievable!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6de/cb4/2d93415a439d40986b74b628ba.png><p>I’d say the last visits were full of&nbsp;impressions, weren’t they? Ready to&nbsp;keep going? A&nbsp;plane ride later, you arrive in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>! The city of&nbsp;lights, berets, and the famous Mona Lisa! You go&nbsp;through the Museum du&nbsp;Louvre and come to&nbsp;Leonardo da&nbsp;Vinci’s masterpiece: La&nbsp;Gioconda. There are many theories regarding this work of&nbsp;art, and you dive into some of&nbsp;them!</p><p>A&nbsp;strong case has been made that the Mona Lisa could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-portrait of&nbsp;da&nbsp;Vinci himself. Historians have thoroughly compared da&nbsp;Vinci’s face and that of&nbsp;the Mona Lisa, and guess what. They appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;strikingly similar. Oh, and then there’s the smirk theory. Dentist and art expert Joseph Bartowski claims to&nbsp;have discovered the secret behind Mona Lisa’s smirk. He&nbsp;says her tight facial expression is&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical indication of&nbsp;someone who lost their front teeth&nbsp;— could it&nbsp;be&nbsp;so?</p><p>Also, in&nbsp;2010 the Italian Committee for Cultural Heritage found a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;symbols hidden in&nbsp;the painting. These are only visible through highly technological magnifying lenses, but they showed that Leonardo inscribed an&nbsp;LV inside Mona Lisa’s right eye. Experts guess that this is&nbsp;da&nbsp;Vinci’s signature. But the other symbols, a&nbsp;CE in&nbsp;the left eye and a&nbsp;72&nbsp;in&nbsp;the arch of&nbsp;the background bridge are still very mysterious. Phew! You covered a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;ground on&nbsp;this one. Ah, of&nbsp;course, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;your visit, remember to&nbsp;test if&nbsp;her eyes really follow you around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/548/5cd/5272965bc8a9c612cfc07cb61a.png><p>Now, you’re headed to&nbsp;Amsterdam to&nbsp;check out the Rijksmuseum. You came to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;specific Rembrandt painting that hides a&nbsp;mysterious story. The Night Watch is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Rembrandt’s most famous paintings, but experts argue that the name of&nbsp;the painting and its content are mismatched! Let’s take a&nbsp;closer look. The painting depicts a&nbsp;large group ready to&nbsp;embark on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Rembrandt’s technique is&nbsp;called chiaroscuro, highlighting the contrast between light and shade. Until 1947, art critics believed the painter was depicting a&nbsp;nighttime scene. But when the painting was cleared of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thick dust layer, it&nbsp;became clear that the scene was happening in&nbsp;broad daylight, with the sun streaming down from the top left. Now, it’s too late to&nbsp;change its name to&nbsp;The Day Watch.</p><p>While in&nbsp;Amsterdam, you find a&nbsp;museum dedicated to&nbsp;Van Gogh’s art. Did you know that he&nbsp;painted over 900 paintings during an&nbsp;impressive period of&nbsp;only 10&nbsp;years? Anyway, the Van Gogh Museum hosts the biggest collection of&nbsp;yellow sunflower paintings you’ll probably see in&nbsp;your life.</p><p>Actually, almost all of&nbsp;Van Gogh’s paintings feature dominant yellow shades. This particularity of&nbsp;his art may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;how he&nbsp;saw the world. Some art experts have speculated that one of&nbsp;Van Gogh’s remedies changed his color perception, making him see more yellow around him. Ok, so&nbsp;this trip just keeps getting better!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cc4/9fc/f839425c17896a8d33d135e27b.png><p>The next stop on&nbsp;your list is&nbsp;the United Kingdom. Then, on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the National Gallery. You may spend hours looking at&nbsp;Jan van Eyck’s painting Arnolfini Portrait and not see anything out of&nbsp;the ordinary. In&nbsp;the foreground, a&nbsp;couple holds hands and stares at&nbsp;the viewer.</p><p>But if&nbsp;you zoom in&nbsp;on&nbsp;the mirror on&nbsp;the wall, you’ll see two more people in&nbsp;the room! Art experts say the male figure in&nbsp;the painting has his hands raised to&nbsp;greet these two people seen in&nbsp;the mirror and that one of&nbsp;the figures is&nbsp;Van Eyck himself! Oh, and that’s not the only watermark the painter left. Above the mirror, you’ll see his flamboyant signature: “Jan van Eyck was here.&nbsp;1434”.</p><p>And speaking of&nbsp;people trying to&nbsp;sneak into their art, Caravaggio, the renowned Italian Renaissance painter, left a&nbsp;little Easter egg in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his famous paintings: Bacchus (ba·kuhs). This one is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit difficult to&nbsp;spot. In&nbsp;the half-filled jar in&nbsp;the bottom left corner of&nbsp;the painting, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny self-portrait of&nbsp;the painter himself hidden amongst the liquid.</p><p>To&nbsp;see the image clearly, one needs the help of&nbsp;sophisticated technology or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least a&nbsp;very efficient magnifying lens. But it’s there: a&nbsp;male figure, aka Caravaggio, with a&nbsp;brush in&nbsp;his hand. Fun fact: the tiny self-portrait was first noticed in&nbsp;1922, over 300 years after the painting was completed. It&nbsp;was forgotten due to&nbsp;poor conservation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/350/49c/98791152468fe62fb71f9618a3.png><p>To&nbsp;finish the trip, you fly overseas across the Atlantic, all the way to&nbsp;Chicago! The enormous collection of&nbsp;the Art Institute hosts a&nbsp;well-known painting by&nbsp;Pablo Picasso: The Old Guitarist. This painting’s secret is&nbsp;so&nbsp;well-hidden that it&nbsp;also needs the help of&nbsp;x-ray machines and super fancy technology. But the results are worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>The readings show that Picasso painted the Old Guitarist on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;another unfinished painting. We&nbsp;can clearly see the outlines and shapes of&nbsp;a&nbsp;half-drawn female figure that Picasso gave up&nbsp;on&nbsp;mid-work. The emerging artists of&nbsp;the time used that way of&nbsp;saving money quite often, as&nbsp;canvases were expensive. This was quite a&nbsp;tiring world trip, wasn’t it? Get some rest, Sherlock of&nbsp;art!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZutc2cqZ6cmZe5pnnSnpqrnaSoeqm1w52cp2WZo3qivtNmpJqrpJq%2FsbXEnJysZWhmgXF8lGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
