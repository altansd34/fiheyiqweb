Unfortunately, knowing the definition of each word doesn’t always help. So, how do you remember what all those nonsensical phrases mean? Luckily, this list of&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British English</a></strong>&nbsp;phrases and their meanings should be able to help you out. Soon those sentences that seem to make no sense will be actually <a href=#>fun to </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">u</a><a href=#>se</a>!</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Top British phrases and their meanings</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Feeling under the weather</h3><p>Despite what it says, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this phrase</a> has nothing to do with the weather. Instead, it’s used as a way to say you’re sick. Keep in mind, however, that you should only use it for less serious illnesses, like a cold.</p><p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t make it to your party.&nbsp;<strong>I was feeling under the weather</strong>.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. As right as rain</h3><p>Rain is cold, wet, and often inconvenient. So, why would you say it’s right?</p><p>Still, this phrase is used to mean that someone is in good health. For example, “Sue was sick over the weekend, but now she’s feeling&nbsp;<strong>right as rain</strong>.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Head over heels</h3><p>Does this involve some kind of exercise?</p><p>Not exactly, but your heart might still be racing. This phrase is used to express excitement and, more often, it’s a way to describe someone who is deeply infatuated or in love.</p><p>“He’s&nbsp;<strong>head over heels</strong>&nbsp;in love with that girl.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Stop waffling</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop what?</a></p><p>Well, you know those times when you’re nervous, or perhaps you’re really excited about something, and you just keep talking until you eventually (hopefully) realise that you’ve forgotten what you were saying?</p><p>That’s known as “waffling” and you’re likely to hear “Stop waffling!” when someone has been rambling.</p><p>“<strong>Stop waffling</strong>&nbsp;and get to the point already!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Jump on the bandwagon</h3><p>There’s no real jumping involved with this phrase. Instead, it’s used to refer to someone who goes along with the crowd or starts supporting something that’s already popular or successful.</p><p>“Last month, she said she hated that band. Now, she’s decided to&nbsp;<strong>jump on the bandwagon</strong>.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Steal someone’s thunder</h3><p>How exactly do you “steal thunder”? Another saying that seems to make no sense.</p><p>In this case, the word “thunder” is meant to reference someone’s big moment or accomplishment. So, this phrase actually means to steal someone’s praise or recognition by doing or saying something first.</p><p>For example, if one of your friends tells everyone about your new job before you get a chance to say anything, they might say, “Sorry to&nbsp;<strong>steal your thunder</strong>, but I just couldn’t keep it in!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Bits and bobs</h3><p>Separately, these words have a few different meanings. However, when used together in a phrase, they refer to lots of small objects or a various collection of things.</p><p>For example, “There might be a matching button in that drawer full of&nbsp;<strong>bits and bobs</strong>&nbsp;in the kitchen.”</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Neck and neck</h3><p>Yes, this is just the same word repeated in a sentence.</p><p>You’ll probably hear it in reference to a competition or sports game. When two people or teams are both doing well and either could easily win, they’re said to be “neck and neck”.</p><p>“Who’s winning?”</p><p>“They’re&nbsp;<strong>neck and neck</strong>&nbsp;right now.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. Pull someone’s leg</h3><p>Why would you pull a person’s leg?</p><p>Well, you wouldn’t do it seriously. This phrase is another way to say you’re making a joke or playing a prank on someone.</p><p>“You’re&nbsp;<strong>pulling my leg</strong>! That didn’t really happen!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>10. Cost an arm and a leg</h3><p>It costs how much?</p><p>That’s exactly the idea behind this phrase, which is used to say that something is expensive or overpriced.</p><p>“I would buy it if it didn’t&nbsp;<strong>cost an arm and a leg</strong>.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>11. By the skin of your teeth</h3><p>This one just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sounds unpleasant</a>.</p><p>Fittingly, it also means that you’ve narrowly missed or escaped something. For instance, “That car almost hit me! I only escaped&nbsp;<strong>by the skin of my teeth</strong>!”</p><p>Do these&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>&nbsp;</strong>phrases make more sense? We hope so!</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States.
