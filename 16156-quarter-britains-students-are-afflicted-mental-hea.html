More than a quarter of students (27%) report having a mental health problem of one type or another.</p><p>Female students are more likely to say they have mental health problems than males (34% vs 19%), and LGBT students have a particularly high likelihood of mental health problems compared to their heterosexual counterparts (45% vs 22%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Mental20health20prevalence-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>For a significant proportion of students who report mental health issues, these problems can make even day-to-day tasks difficult. Nearly half (47%) say that that they have trouble completing some daily tasks and a further 4% say they cannot complete even simple tasks.</p><p>Depression and anxiety are by far the most common reported mental health ailments. Of those who suffer, 77% have depression-related problems, and 74% have anxiety related problems. Worse still, for many of these students it is common for students to be afflicted with both at once – 74% of students with an anxiety-related problem also have a depression-related one. These two issues dwarf all the rest, with eating disorders being the next most common at 14%, followed by behavioural or developmental issues at 5% and learning disabilities, also at 5%.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Mental20health20types-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Anxiety and stress are commonplace among students, and the effects are often obstructive. Six in ten (63%) students say that they feel levels of stress that interfere with their day to day lives. Additionally, 77% of all students report that they have a fear of failure, with one in five of these saying that this fear is very prevalent in their day to day life.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, study is the primary cause of stress among students. Seven in ten (71%) say that work from university is one of their main sources of stress. The next biggest concern for students is finding a job after university (39%), followed by their family (35%). Jobs and relationships (23% each) and friends (22%) account for the majority of the other sources of stress.</p><h4>Help is on hand</h4><p>Fortunately, students are broadly aware that mental health services are provided by their university. Three quarters of students were aware that their university had a counselling service they could access. Only 14% weren’t aware of any services available to them.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Quality20of20mental20health20services-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Nearly one in five (18%) of students have already made use of university mental health services, the vast majority of whom (89%) had visited a counsellor. Satisfaction levels are relatively high, with 30% saying that they found the service very helpful and a further 45% saying it was somewhat helpful.</p><p>There is much room for improvement though, with one in five (21%) said that it was not helpful at all. Additionally, half of students who have made use of university mental health services also make use of professional health through other means.</p><h4>Students accept that mental health is a real issue</h4><p>For students who are suffering from mental health issues, it will hopefully provide a crumb of comfort to know that their peers are aware of and accept their mental health problems.</p><p>More than half of students (52%) know between one and five people that suffer from a mental illness, whereas just 8% know no-one with mental health problems.</p><p>And whereas in days gone by the seriousness of mental health problems might be trivialised, this is no longer the case. The overwhelming majority of students (84%) accept that mental illness is as serious as physical illness. Just 6% felt that physical ailments were more serious than mental ones (a further 5% felt that mental illness was more serious).</p><p>Students are also sympathetic to mental health sufferers. Upon finding that a person had mental health problems, the vast majority of students (74%) say that they would show concern and be mindful of that person’s troubles. A further 19% say that they wouldn’t react as it wouldn’t change how they saw that person, whilst a mere 3% say that they would be more cautious around a person with mental health issues.</p><p>Photo: PA</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p><span>Save</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpZmaCd3nQrpirrJWneqO%2ByK2YoqajYsC1wcOepa2rXZa%2FpnnAn52loZOpsqV5zJ6lrZmcYrWmrQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
