Thus, when he denies a vocal ability, artists must take it as a chance to prove him wrong.</strong></p><p>We compiled 10 singing auditions that Simon Cowell didn’t love in the beginning. Here are the artists who dared to change his mind about their skill and became successful in doing so.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-souparnika-nair>1. Souparnika Nair</h2><p>Souparnika Nair was a 10-year-old singer who originally sang to “Trolley Song” by Judy Garland during her audition <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent</a> on series 14. Unimpressed, Cowell asked her to perform another song, and there she belted “Never Enough” by Loren Allred. What happened next was amazing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/ZSNDkmZiHk4</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Ansley Burns</h2><p>Singing “Think” by Aretha Franklin, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ansley Burns</a> tried to shoot her shot 0n America’s Got Talent season 14. Apparently, Cowell would like to hear her voice without any background track. Nervous at first but determined to get in, Burns did what was asked of her and awed the audience afterwards.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Shaheen Jafargholi</h2><p>Shaheen Jafargholi was aged twelve whens he auditioned for Britain’s Got Talent series 3. He tried to get yeses by singing to “Valerie” by Amy Winehouse, but Cowell harshly commented that his song choice was wrong. Jafargholi then decided to sing “Who’s Lovin’ you” by Michael Jackson, ultimately reaching Cowell’s standard.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Daniel Emmet</h2><p>Daniel Emmet attempted to get the judges’ nods with his original song “Amante,” but that only propelled Cowell to stop his AGT season 13 audition. The mogul asked if he has a backup song which he didn’t have, so Cowell tasked him to study Il Divo’s “Passera” backstage. Emmet took the challenge and came back, finally getting Cowell’s approval.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Scarlett Lee</h2><p>Scarlett Lee auditioned for the The X Factor season 15 with her self-written song “Survival.” However, Cowell interrupted her in the middle of her performance and dared her to sing another song. She decided to sing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Loren Allred</a>’s “Never Enough” which earned her a loud applause and four yeses.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Jimmie Herrod</h2><p>Jimmie Herrod came to audition for America’s Got Talent season 16, not knowing that he’s going to sing the “worst song in the world,” at least according to Cowell. Nevertheless, despite the risk, Herrod proceeded to sing “Tomorrow” from the musical Annie as he doesn’t have a second song prepared. After the performance, Cowell admitted that “Tomorrow” didn’t seem so bad anymore.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Joseph McCaul</h2><p>Joseph McCaul is an Irish singer who had a messy start on the first attempt of his audition on The X Factor season 12. Thus, when the judges gave him another chance, it wasn’t his to waste. He subsequently performed Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,” successfully making it to the next round.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXe77y52qSk</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Cristina Rae</h2><p>Initially singing “In The Air Tonight” by Phil Collins, Cristina Rae failed to impress Cowell in her AGT season 15 audition. Nevertheless, the music mogul seemed to have seen potential and asked her to sing a different song. She then belted “Gimme Shelter” by The Rolling Stones, consequently securing a Golden Buzzer from Heidi Klum.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Sian Pattison</h2><p>It was Sian Pattison’s daughter that originally sent an application on her behalf because she was extremely nervous about joining the competition. In the midst of her BGT series 11 audition, Cowell cut her off and told her that her song choice wasn’t right. She then performed “With You” from Ghost: The Musical, proving her daughter right for signing her up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/7WcZVyJwMlM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Connor Johnson</h2><p>Entering America’s Got Talent season 17 armed with his voice and guitar, Connor Johnson sang “Forever” by Lewis. Unluckily, Cowell found this boring and stopped him halfway through the performance. The music mogul demanded to hear something else so he gave him “Latch” by Disclosure.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUIHeP6dEpc</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bad-golden-buzzers.jpg alt="10 Most Controversial Golden Buzzers in ‘Got Talent’ History" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57kGlkoKekYsGiuMSnq2armaO0pr7SZq6hp12lv7DCxJ1krKGdpLtur86wnKWkXay%2FsLrGaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
