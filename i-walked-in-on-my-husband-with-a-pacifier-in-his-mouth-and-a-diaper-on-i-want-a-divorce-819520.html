Our reader’s husband has always loved these things. However, lately, he’s been acting really weird. She started to&nbsp;worry he&nbsp;might be&nbsp;hiding something big, and the truth was terrifying.</p><p><h2>We&nbsp;got a&nbsp;message from our reader.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b8/36a/4caf865e8aaf26ec3acfc14bc8.jpg><p>Thank you for sharing your story with&nbsp;us! It’s a&nbsp;tricky situation indeed, and we&nbsp;have some tips that might help you figure out how to&nbsp;proceed.</p><p><h2>Calm down first.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e8c/1c4/cdcbe45044a03b1e8c6743f0b9.jpg><p>After the initial shock, find a&nbsp;quiet place to&nbsp;sit and breathe. Let yourself process what you saw without acting impulsively. Sort through your emotions and get ready for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calm</a> conversation with your husband. Don’t make any hasty decisions about your <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. Give yourself at&nbsp;least a&nbsp;few days to&nbsp;let the shock wear off before taking any action.</p><p><h2>Talk to&nbsp;him.</h2></p><p>Have an&nbsp;honest conversation with your husband. Make sure you are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>calm</a> state of&nbsp;mind. Tell him something along the lines&nbsp;of, “I&nbsp;was shocked when&nbsp;I saw what you were doing.” Encourage him to&nbsp;share his side. Try to&nbsp;understand his motives and really listen to&nbsp;what he&nbsp;says without interrupting.</p><p><h2>Take him to&nbsp;a&nbsp;therapist.</h2></p><p>Offer your husband to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;therapy. Avoid making it&nbsp;seem like a&nbsp;punishment or&nbsp;that something is&nbsp;“wrong” with him. Perhaps he&nbsp;has some hidden issues or&nbsp;post-trauma. A&nbsp;therapist can help uncover and work through these underlying problems. Try not to&nbsp;judge, instead show your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commitment</a> to&nbsp;working through this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;team.</p><p><h2>Decide what’s acceptable for you.</h2></p><p>Think about what you are comfortable with in&nbsp;your relationship. See if&nbsp;there are some specific things or&nbsp;situations that you can’t accept. Set clear <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>boundaries</a> and be&nbsp;honest about what you can tolerate and what you can’t. If&nbsp;you are still in&nbsp;shock and can’t forget what you saw, perhaps giving yourself some space will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;better option.</p><p><a href=# title=Family data-link=tag>Family</a> disagreements can be&nbsp;tough, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;raising kids. One of&nbsp;our <a href=#>readers</a> has a&nbsp;vegan daughter who’s raising her children with the same <a href=# title=diet data-link=tag>diet</a>. Recently, she noticed that her kids seem tired and always complain about being hungry.
