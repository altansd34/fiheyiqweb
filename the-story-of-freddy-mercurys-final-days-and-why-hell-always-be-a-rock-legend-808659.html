As&nbsp;we&nbsp;celebrate this milestone, 3&nbsp;quarters of&nbsp;a&nbsp;century since he&nbsp;came to&nbsp;be, let’s dive a&nbsp;bit deeper into how he&nbsp;became Freddie Mercury, who he&nbsp;loved, and how he&nbsp;spent his final days.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> believes some people were born to&nbsp;make history; let’s see how Freddie did it&nbsp;and uncover some little-known facts about him.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was born with extra teeth&nbsp;— a&nbsp;superpower that brought Freddie the recognition he&nbsp;deserved.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/348/fe2/41d3185381914a3c9ed8bd5594.jpg><p>Freddie’s nickname growing up&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bucky</a> because of&nbsp;his famous bucktooth grin. The star with supernumerary teeth never got them fixed because he&nbsp;believed his impressive 4-octave vocal range would never be&nbsp;the same. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>7</a>, Freddie was already taking piano classes.&nbsp;5&nbsp;years later, he’d go&nbsp;on&nbsp;to&nbsp;join his first band, The Hectics.</p><p>On&nbsp;June&nbsp;2, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1969</a>, Freddie became a&nbsp;British citizen, and soon after, his family immigrated to&nbsp;England. After graduating from Ealing Art College, he&nbsp;joined different bands, while selling Edwardian clothes and scarves at&nbsp;the London market. He&nbsp;did all this while working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;baggage <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>handler</a> at&nbsp;Heathrow Airport.</p><h2>“When I’m performing, I’m an&nbsp;extrovert, yet inside I’m a&nbsp;completely different <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>man</a>.”&nbsp;— Freddie&nbsp;M.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eff/72a/256601512d93eb67c8b3560166.jpg><p>Courtesy Everett Collection / East News</p><p>In&nbsp;1970, when the band Smile’s lead singer quit, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Farrokh</a> replaced him. At&nbsp;this point, he’d already been friends with the other band members, guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor.<i> Smile</i> turned into <i><a href=# title=Queen data-link=tag>Queen</a></i> and the rest is&nbsp;history.</p><p>Well, it&nbsp;wasn’t that simple. Around this time, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Farrokh</a> Bulsara officially became Freddie Mercury.&nbsp;3&nbsp;years after the band came together, they released their first 2&nbsp;albums, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Queen</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Queen&nbsp;II</i></a>, blending elements of&nbsp;heavy metal and glam rock, but they didn’t break any charts. The third time proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;charm, as&nbsp;they say, because their third album, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sheer Heart Attack</i></a><i>, </i>shook the international charts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5dd/709/e84ebb5f7a89f7a367f6f8133d.jpg><p>“Bohemian Rhapsody,” which can be&nbsp;found on&nbsp;their album, <i>A&nbsp;Night at&nbsp;the Opera</i>,<i> </i>and is&nbsp;still popular today, 50&nbsp;years after its debut, was written mainly by&nbsp;Freddie, and spent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>9</a>&nbsp;weeks atop the British singles chart. “We&nbsp;Are the Champions” and “We&nbsp;Will Rock You” followed in&nbsp;1977, and by&nbsp;the early ’80s, Queen was deemed an&nbsp;international phenomenon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a2/cbf/c37c5f50f5ab244c3ee9422c3d.jpg><p>KYDPL KYODO/Associated Press/East News</p><p>One of&nbsp;Queen’s most memorable career milestones was recognized at&nbsp;the Live Aid concert in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1985</a>. In&nbsp;front of&nbsp;72,000 live viewers and a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TV </a>audience of&nbsp;close to&nbsp;2&nbsp;billion, the band delivered a&nbsp;stellar performance, and Freddie dominated the stage like an&nbsp;experienced ventriloquist, controlling his audience. Today, this concert is&nbsp;widely known as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>greatest</a> performance of&nbsp;all time.</p><p><h2>Freddie had 2&nbsp;special relationships&nbsp;— one with Mary and one with James.</h2></p><p>During his life, Freddie admitted to&nbsp;having multiple partners. However, only 2&nbsp;people made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;the most special. Mercury met Mary Austin in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1969</a> and got engaged in&nbsp;1973, while dedicating the song, “Love of&nbsp;My&nbsp;Life” to&nbsp;her.</p><p>Years later, while Freddie couldn’t deny his attraction to&nbsp;men, he&nbsp;admitted to&nbsp;Mary that he&nbsp;was bisexual. Mary later said, “I’ll never forget that moment. I&nbsp;remember saying to&nbsp;him, ’<strong>No, Freddie, I&nbsp;don’t think you’re bisexual. I&nbsp;think you are </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>gay</strong></a><strong>.</strong>’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/234/d3d/8cddc954efac04b1d9ada1a851.jpg><p>“<strong>All my&nbsp;lovers asked me&nbsp;why they couldn’t replace Mary, but it’s simply impossible</strong>,” Mercury said in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1985</a>&nbsp;interview. “The only friend I’ve got is&nbsp;Mary, and&nbsp;I don’t want anybody else. To&nbsp;me, she was my&nbsp;common-law wife. To&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;marriage. We&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;each other, that’s enough for&nbsp;me.” The couple remained close until his last days.</p><p><i>On&nbsp;the left is&nbsp;Jim Hutton, Freddie’s boyfriend.</i></p><p>James Hutton, an&nbsp;Irish-born hairdresser, Freddie’s boyfriend, and life <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>partner</a>, was someone the singer met in&nbsp;a&nbsp;gay nightclub back in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>’80s</a>. The 2&nbsp;were together for 7&nbsp;years, and James stood by&nbsp;Mercury’s side all the way to&nbsp;the end. When Freddie made his first advances, James had no&nbsp;idea how famous he&nbsp;was. It&nbsp;wasn’t love at&nbsp;first sight, however, the couple lived a&nbsp;happy, quiet life together. James <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “<strong>He&nbsp;loved his cats.</strong> I’d get in&nbsp;from work. We’d lie together on&nbsp;the sofa. He&nbsp;would massage my&nbsp;feet and ask about my&nbsp;day.”</p><p><h2>Freddie’s HIV diagnosis was kept private, but this didn’t stop him from doing what he&nbsp;loved, creating music.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18e/a6b/63a5a756979c372e6d3670541d.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p>Around <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1987</a>, Mercury received his HIV diagnosis and chose to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;away from the public eye. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>He</a>&nbsp;always said, “<strong>I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;put any burden on&nbsp;other people by&nbsp;telling them my&nbsp;tragedy</strong>.” At&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>time</a>, the frowned-upon virus was at&nbsp;its peak all around the world and effective treatments for it&nbsp;were, sadly, yet to&nbsp;be&nbsp;discovered. The rock <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> icon lost many friends to&nbsp;AIDS and always hoped it&nbsp;would never happen to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>him</a>.</p><p>The next year, fans noticed Freddie seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;feeling unwell. In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1990</a>, when Queen accepted their award for Outstanding Contribution to&nbsp;British music, Freddie had a&nbsp;sickly appearance.</p><p><h2>Despite being unwell, Freddie kept working until his final days.</h2></p><p>Even during his struggle with the harsh condition of&nbsp;HIV, Freddie tried to&nbsp;keep his spirits&nbsp;up. When able, he&nbsp;would visit the studio 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;hours at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time and, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>according to&nbsp;Brian May</a>, say, “’<strong>Write me&nbsp;more.</strong> Write me&nbsp;stuff. <strong>I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;just sing this</strong> and do&nbsp;it&nbsp;and when I&nbsp;am gone you can finish it&nbsp;off.’ He&nbsp;had no&nbsp;fear, really.”</p><p>The last music <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> Queen ever released, “These Are the Days of&nbsp;Our Lives”, showcased a&nbsp;thin, frail <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Freddie</a>, sporting a&nbsp;cat vest, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;kept trying to&nbsp;entertain&nbsp;us until the very end. The video ends with Freddie looking straight into the camera and singing, “Those were the days of&nbsp;our lives, the bad things in&nbsp;life were so&nbsp;few. Those days are all gone now but one thing’s still true; when&nbsp;I look and I&nbsp;find, <strong>I&nbsp;still love you!”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/863/b23/ab23cc596e89133d3e28ebe30a.png><p>Just one day before he&nbsp;passed away in&nbsp;November <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1991</a>, Freddie made his diagnosis public:</p><p>“Following enormous conjecture in&nbsp;the press, I&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;confirm that&nbsp;I have been tested HIV positive and have AIDS. I&nbsp;felt it&nbsp;correct to&nbsp;keep this information private in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;protect the privacy of&nbsp;those around&nbsp;me. However, the time has now come for my&nbsp;friends and fans around the world to&nbsp;know the truth, and&nbsp;I hope everyone will join with&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;doctors, and all those worldwide in&nbsp;the fight against this terrible disease.”</p><p>Freddie Mercury passed away on&nbsp;November 24&nbsp;at only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>45</a>&nbsp;years old. We&nbsp;will remember his legacy forever and always cherish Queen’s music that will survive for decades, centuries, and, hopefully, millennia. To&nbsp;Freddie, we&nbsp;bow and thank you for every shiver down our spines and every song that you’ve left&nbsp;us, forever.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know the lyrics to<i>&nbsp;</i>“Bohemian Rhapsody?” How did you find out about Queen?
