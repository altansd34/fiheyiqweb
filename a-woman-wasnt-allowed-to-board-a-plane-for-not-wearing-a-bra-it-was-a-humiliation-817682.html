However, just before her flight was set to&nbsp;take off, Lisa was called out by&nbsp;the airport staff for her attire, which was deemed “offensive.” While some supported her, others believed the airline was justified in&nbsp;refusing her boarding.</p><p><h2>The issue arose because she was not wearing a&nbsp;bra.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/001/c55/c28b14543f9850db0beeb66659.jpg><p>DJ&nbsp;and entrepreneur Lisa Archbold had attended the Sundance Film Festival in&nbsp;Salt Lake City and was returning to&nbsp;San Francisco on&nbsp;January&nbsp;22. Just as&nbsp;all passengers had boarded the plane, a&nbsp;<strong>crew member called her aside for a&nbsp;private conversation.</strong> Lisa was wearing loose-fitting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attire</a>—a white t-shirt and trousers—but had opted not to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;<a href=# title=bra data-link=tag>bra</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12c/812/d806f65280931bf815e067c25f.jpg><p>The crew member insisted that Lisa could only remain on&nbsp;the flight if&nbsp;she wore a&nbsp;jacket, which Lisa had removed due to&nbsp;the unusually warm weather in&nbsp;Salt Lake City. Lisa found this request perplexing, especially since the flight was only an&nbsp;hour and a&nbsp;half long. She felt embarrassed by&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>situation</a>, <strong>“It&nbsp;wasn’t logical&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was humiliation.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ba/554/d9d1c35e9b9038806dd614cf98.jpg><p>After a&nbsp;lengthy lecture, the crew member allowed Lisa to&nbsp;re-board the flight only after she put her jacket back&nbsp;on. Upon arrival, Lisa voiced her concerns to&nbsp;the head flight attendant, citing discrimination based on&nbsp;the treatment she received. The flight attendant’s response, stating that <strong>women </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>must</strong></a><strong> cover up&nbsp;according to&nbsp;Delta Airlines’ policy</strong>, further dismayed Lisa. She has lodged a&nbsp;formal complaint with the airline and awaits a&nbsp;response.</p><p><h2>This situation caused a&nbsp;heated discussion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fc/e86/5ae9475e24b7b127d4db78e5f0.jpg><p>There were mixed opinions on&nbsp;whether the airline’s decision was justified or&nbsp;not. Some individuals supported the airline, suggesting that Lisa’s attire was inappropriate. One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “I’m on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the airline, <strong>just dress appropriately and problem solved</strong>.” On&nbsp;the other hand, another commenter sarcastically pointed out that not wearing a&nbsp;bra should not be&nbsp;considered <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>illegal</a>.</p><p>Certainly, this isn’t the only instance where a&nbsp;passenger has been denied boarding due to&nbsp;their attire. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar incident, a&nbsp;woman attempted to&nbsp;board a&nbsp;plane wearing a&nbsp;<a href=#>bikini</a>, but airport personnel stopped her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uw86mmKdlp5bAr8CMmqOlp6easW7AzmaZqJmimXqiec%2BlmKedXZu8s3nNqKtmr5WWv6q6xmaYZpqilnqqwIywmKxlkWK1trnIpaCarJmku26EkHBtcWpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
