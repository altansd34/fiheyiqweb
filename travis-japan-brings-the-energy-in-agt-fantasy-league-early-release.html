The group delivered an energetic song and dance routine on judge Mel B’s dream team.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-japan-performs-in-agt-fantasy-league-early-release>Travis Japan Performs in AGT: Fantasy League Early Release</h2><p>Travis Japan first competed on Season 17 of America’s Got Talent, reaching the Semifinals. During their last performance, judge Howie Mandel buzzed them. Ahead of their Fantasy League performance, they admitted that they “did not do our best singing that night.”</p><p>The group is competing on Fantasy League on Mel B’s team. The judge said it was “no-brainer,” since they’re a boy band, and she got her start in a girl group. During rehearsals, Mel commented on their “complicated choreography,” especially compared to the Spice Girls.</p><p>This time, the group set out to prove themselves. They delivered a performance of their original song, “Just Dance!” It was accompanied by a fun dance routine that featured a few acrobatic moves. Three of the judges gave them a standing ovation.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET ‘AGT’S ENERGETIC DANCING, SINGING GROUP TRAVIS JAPAN</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-the-judges-think-of-the-performance>What Did the Judges Think of the Performance?</h2><p>Judge Heidi Klum told Travis Japan that they “totally improved from the last time we saw you guys,” adding her praise for their decision to return to the stage after being buzzed. Meanwhile, Cowell admitted that they’re “not the best singers in the world,” and it “wasn’t the best song I’ve ever heard.”</p><p>However, the judge still shared a positive response to their performance, telling the group, “I love the fact that you are old school. And actually, every time you come on, it makes me feel happy. This was way better than the first audition.”</p><p>Mel tried to stop Mandel from giving his opinion, but he eventually managed to tell the group, “It doesn’t matter what I say, because ultimately the audience has the choice. The audience votes.” After they left the stage, he did say it was “a little corny.”</p><p>You can watch a new episode of AGT: Fantasy League Monday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_HowieMandel_Qualifers2_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Howie Mandel Calls Out Andy Cohen for ‘Jackhole’ Diss After Tom Sandoval Interview" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706uYr6GjYreivMCnZJuqmaO0tHnToZxmnZ6av6jFjKKlZpmXqXqnrc2tmKyxXaGyorPUnmSemaKhxm6%2BxKWcmquVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
