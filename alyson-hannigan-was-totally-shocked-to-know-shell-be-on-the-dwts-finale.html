Hence, when Ribeiro announced their inclusion, her surprised reaction was evident.</p><p>“I thought Alfonso [Ribeiro] made a mistake,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “I thought he meant to say Ariana [Madix] and he said my names first and I just was waiting for him to correct himself and then I couldn’t believe it.”</p><p>According to the American Pie star, she was “totally shocked” to find out the news. She added that she felt like she was going to throw up, practically similar to what she felt “all season.”</p><p>Last Tuesday, Ribeiro and co-host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julianne Hough</a> announced that all pairs in the Semifinals will advance to the season Finale. These include Vanderpump Rules Madix and her partner Pasha Pashkov, and Marvel actress Xochitl Gomez and dancing pro Val Chmerkovskiy.</p><p>Bachelorette star Charity Lawson and partner Artem Chigvintsev, plus singer Jason Mraz and pro Daniella Karagach are the ones completing the final five.</p><p>Hannigan and Farber netted a 26 out of 30 for their waltz to “Come Away With Me” by Norah Jones.</p><p>“I have learned so much,” she said. “I’ve learned that I am capable of doing things that I’ve told myself my whole life that I’m not capable of doing, and to really just go in with a positive attitude and try and work hard.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-talks-insane-body-transformation-due-to-the-show>She Talks “Insane” Body Transformation Due to the Show</h2><p>After surviving 10 grueling weeks of the competition, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How I Met Your Mother star</a> has intentionally achieved a physically fit body. With Farber witnessing how “insane” her body transformation became, the actress said the pro has been calling it “Body by Sasha.”</p><p>“Contact me on social media to make you look like this,” Farber <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">joked</a>.</p><p>Alongside her intense physical activity due to DWTS, however, Hannigan shared that her days of “healthy eating” were over. According to her, she’s now just mostly focused on feeding herself enough calories each dancing day.</p><p>“The PT [physical therapist] said ‘oh you should have milk and bananas before bed for calcium and potassium’ and we were out of milk so we had ice cream,” Hannigan said.</p><p>While being sent to the DWTS Finale is a remarkable milestone for her, she admits that the last week was hard for her. The actress shared that she still struggles in perfecting her and Farber’s dancing routines.</p><p>“This week was so hard for me,” she said. “My body’s falling apart, my knee wants to leave my leg and the jive is just a mean dance. It’s really awful, it’s awful.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With the Stars</a> season 32 finale airs on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesday, Dec. 5 at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_TheVoice_Blank_Generic_Keyart_NBCUniversal-220x147.jpeg alt="Top 7 Best Auditions Ever On ‘The Voice UK’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKWwrKeeYrWius2inpqmXayutHnTqKuapJyuerS0zpyinpxdqbxut82ormarmJq5rXnBnmSopl2ptaZ5w7CrrGWWnruiuMRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
