Many think that the series just found their season 17 winner.</strong></p><p>On June 1, So You Think You Can Dance aired Thiago’s contemporary audition. After two episodes of auditions, this dancer set himself apart from others with his edgy look and polished dance moves. His breathtaking dance brought the audience to their feet. Even though the judges didn’t say much about his performance, it was obvious they liked it, they immediately sent him through to the next round.</p><p>The excitement behind this audition lies in the fact that it left viewers wanting more. Since he was already impressive in auditions, fans are hoping he makes it far in the competition.</p><p>“Thiago Pacheco is going to win this season of #SYTYCD If not, America is crazy for not voting for them but definitely top 5,” a fan <a href=#>wrote</a> on Twitter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-was-thiago-pacheco-up-to-before-so-you-think-you-can-dance>What Was Thiago Pacheco Up to Before So You Think You Can Dance?</h2><p>This 18 year old is originally from Massachusetts, but has been training in Miami with the Stars Dance Studio. Other notable So You Think You Can Dance alum that trained with this company are Victor Smalley (season six), Ricky Ubeda (season 11), Cristina Moya-Palacios (season 11), and more.</p><p>Before appearing on So You Think You Can Dance, Thiago had multiple years of competitions under his belt. In 2021, he won second place at both <a href=#>The Dance Awards</a> and the 24 Seven Dance Dance convention. A year prior he won first place at the Jump Dance Convention and he appeared as a national teen core performer in Radix’s 2021 dance convention.</p><p>During his years of performing, Thiago has been featured on the YouTube page, CarmoDance, which strives to publish the best dance content. His performances have gained thousands of views on the platform.</p><p>Although fans were quickly impressed by Thiago’s skills, he remains unknown for the most part. After his jaw dropping audition, he has over 10,600 followers on Instagram and 8,128 followers on TikTok. It seems like Thiago does not have a dance dedicated YouTube or Facebook page at this time.</p><p>So You Think You Can Dance returns to FOX on Wednesday, June 8.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SYTYCD_0771-1-1.jpg alt="Matthew Morrison Breaks Silence on His Departure from ‘So You Think You Can Dance’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>so you think you can dance</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>thiago pacheco</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYsCwediorGasmJ67rHnYqKxmm5GjeqWtzZycZquklrulu9StZK2gmZa0sHnPmpqhnZOkfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
