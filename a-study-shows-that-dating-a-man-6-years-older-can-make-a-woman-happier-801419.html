Maturity, emotional stability, and wisdom are among the top things women look for in&nbsp;men. And this is&nbsp;precisely why most of&nbsp;them go&nbsp;for men who are a&nbsp;little <a href=#>older</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>would like to&nbsp;share with you a&nbsp;very curious study that shows that most women think their perfect partner is&nbsp;6&nbsp;years older than them.</p><p><h2>This is&nbsp;why some women prefer dating older men.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/405/406/dc0c4f54eb8e92cd7a5bac2f65.jpg><p>We’ve all heard that some women prefer dating older men, what are the reasons for this exactly? Some people might give this relationship negative stereotypes or&nbsp;stigmas, like the so-called “gold-digging” motive, but it&nbsp;turns out that is&nbsp;not the case with many couples. This may or&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;true in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;cases, as&nbsp;many women have different reasons to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with someone who is&nbsp;older than them.</p><p>So&nbsp;what are the real reasons? Women on&nbsp;Reddit have the answers for&nbsp;us:</p><ul><li>“They are also a&nbsp;lot more straightforward so&nbsp;there are very few games, if&nbsp;any.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>Keirabella999</a></li><li>“Stability. Maturity. Wisdom.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>WhEnPaInLoVeS</a></li><li>“I&nbsp;think it’s this idea that life experience makes them more emotionally resilient, stable, and straightforward about what they want.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>BLESS_YER_HEART</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56c/c1b/003aac590d98ff78f5c483545e.jpg><ul><li>“Simply because they are more mature. They (not all of&nbsp;them) treat you with respect, talk to&nbsp;you, listen to&nbsp;you, share with you, and have had much more experience in&nbsp;life.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>Joaziez</a></li><li>“They tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more mature, knowledgeable, and know what they want in&nbsp;life. They also more often than not are looking for a&nbsp;committed relationship, which is&nbsp;what I&nbsp;want.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>KitKatCarKat</a></li><li>“It’s nice dating people more settled in&nbsp;their lives, who know what they want for their future more clearly. They usually have more independence. Also if&nbsp;a&nbsp;guy hits a&nbsp;certain age without learning some basic survival skills, I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;date them.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>Codydarkstalker</a></li></ul><p><h2>The ideal age-gap for dating is&nbsp;6&nbsp;years, where the man is&nbsp;older.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33c/0fe/9c803d59f499a20784cc92af5f.jpg><p>We&nbsp;may often see significant age-gaps in&nbsp;some romantic movies, but the truth is&nbsp;that the ideal age difference in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;big. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> conducted by&nbsp;<a href=#>WhatsYourPrice.com</a>, a&nbsp;website that allows people to&nbsp;buy and sell first dates, the ideal age-gap is&nbsp;6&nbsp;years, where the man is&nbsp;the older one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90f/f0f/9742c256d4a85b72931709c7fd.jpg><p>The study looked at&nbsp;the price of&nbsp;over 100,000 first dates between older men and younger women. And the findings were that women are most attracted to&nbsp;men who are 6&nbsp;years older than they are. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Brandon Wade</a>, the CEO of&nbsp;WhatsYourPrice.com, “Women tend to&nbsp;mature faster than men. For this reason, most women don’t like to&nbsp;date men around their age or&nbsp;who are younger than they are.” He&nbsp;also added that aside from the 6-year-age gap, women, in&nbsp;general, prefer to&nbsp;date men who are less than 10&nbsp;years older.</p><p><h2>Here’s what celebrities have to&nbsp;say about their age-gap relationships:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e4/828/5d1cff560d8be50284b11d51a5.jpg><ul><li><strong>Calista Flockhart</strong>, who is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# title="Harrison Ford" data-link=tag>Harrison Ford</a></strong>, claims that the age difference isn’t a&nbsp;problem for her. She <a href=#>shared</a>: “It&nbsp;doesn’t faze&nbsp;me. Sometimes I&nbsp;even say, ’Wow, I&nbsp;keep forgetting that he’s 22&nbsp;years older than me’.”</li><li><strong>Hilaria Baldwin </strong><a href=#>admits</a> that she did not expect to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;lot older than her: “I&nbsp;didn’t expect to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with somebody who was 26&nbsp;years my&nbsp;senior, but you cannot help who you fall in&nbsp;love with.”</li><li><strong>Sir Patrick Stewart </strong>married musician <strong>Sunny Ozell </strong>who is&nbsp;39&nbsp;years younger than him. Sunny <a href=#>shared</a> her thoughts on&nbsp;their age-gap: “He&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;youthful and&nbsp;I guess I’m kind of&nbsp;an&nbsp;old worrywart so&nbsp;we&nbsp;bridge the gap. It&nbsp;doesn’t come up&nbsp;much.

The actor <a href=#>shared</a> how he&nbsp;felt about Hayley: “For the longest time&nbsp;I didn’t think it&nbsp;was right to&nbsp;marry Hayley, as&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;much older and&nbsp;I didn’t want to&nbsp;take away the fun and the youth and the excitement of&nbsp;growing old together and having children,” he&nbsp;said. “We’ve been together for about 7&nbsp;years and we’ve had such a&nbsp;great time. <strong>I’ve realized how much&nbsp;I love Hayley and how much we’ve become part of&nbsp;each other’s life</strong>,” he&nbsp;continued.</li><li>Actor <strong>Dennis Quaid </strong>and his wife <strong>Laura Savoie </strong>have been through their fair share of&nbsp;criticism on&nbsp;their 39-year age-gap, but that didn’t affect the couple. Dennis <a href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;it: “I&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;out looking for an&nbsp;age gap or&nbsp;someone really younger than&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;met her at&nbsp;a&nbsp;business event and then the relationship developed. You have no&nbsp;control over who you fall in&nbsp;love with. I&nbsp;don’t fall in&nbsp;love easily. But I&nbsp;can’t let what a&nbsp;few people think control all that. <strong>I’ve been married 3&nbsp;times and this is&nbsp;the final one, I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;is. I&nbsp;feel like&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;real partner in&nbsp;life</strong>.”</li></ul><p>What are your thoughts on&nbsp;age-gap relationships?
