From wild fan interactions, trips to the emergency room, proposals, and more! In honor of the historic thirtieth season, let’s look back at the 10 most shocking moments on <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-ryan-lochte-protestors-rush-the-stage>10. Ryan Lochte Protestors Rush the Stage</h3><p>During season 23, two men from the audience rushed the stage in an attempt to protest contestant, and Olympic Swimmer, Ryan Lochte. His stint on the show came after he was caught lying about being held at gunpoint in Brazil while competing in the 2016 games.&nbsp;</p><p>For this reason, protestors sporting anti-Lochte t-shirts became aggressive and stormed the stage after his performance. Security wasted no time and tackled the men to the ground.&nbsp;It was truly a sight to see.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-sharna-burgess-s-mortifying-nip-slip>9. Sharna Burgess’s Mortifying Nip Slip</h3><p>On season 22, pro dancer <a href=#>Sharna Burgess</a> faced a wardrobe malfunction that had the styling team stocking up on double sided tape.&nbsp;After performing the tango with NFL player, Antonio Brown, producers were quick to notify, host Tom Bergeron of Burgess’s fashion mishap.&nbsp;All commentary halted completely as she was told to pull up her dress for the family on live television.&nbsp;In an <a href=#>interview</a>, Burgess even said that her outfits now get triple checked before each performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-marie-osmond-faints-on-stage>8. Marie Osmond Faints on Stage</h3><p>This shocking scene from season five came just moments after the singer completed a lively samba routine with partner Jonathan Roberts.&nbsp;In the middle of judge <a href=#>Len Goodman’s</a> critique, Osmond closed her eyes and collapsed to the ground.&nbsp;The entire room was filled with great concern as Bergeron immediately cut to a commercial break.&nbsp;The scene was handled professionally, despite the scare.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-juan-pablo-di-pace-and-cheryl-burke-eliminated>7. Juan Pablo Di Pace and Cheryl Burke Eliminated</h3><p>The Fuller House star wowed the judges on season 27 with his amazing energy and technical skill.&nbsp;The duo even earned a perfect score of 60 in week seven, so what followed soon after came as a complete shock.&nbsp;The pair was axed in a brutal double elimination, and sparked an uproar of outrage.&nbsp;Judge <a href=#>Carrie Ann Inaba</a> called the decision “wrong.” Even Len Goodman chimed in to say&nbsp;“there is no justice here.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-melissa-gilbert-rushed-to-the-er>6. Melissa Gilbert Rushed to the ER</h3><p>Actress Melissa Gilbert suffered whiplash and a concussion during her passo doble performance in 2012.&nbsp;Toward the end of the performance, her partner <a href=#>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</a> fell while he was twirling Gilbert.&nbsp;But what viewers didn’t see, was the star hitting her head on the ground in that moment. As the show continued, she became increasingly dizzy and was rushed to the emergency room. Her co-star Gavin DeGraw was even shown carrying her down the stairs to ensure her safety.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-embed readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/rSbF6PpIOTM</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-master-p-receives-lowest-score-on-dwts-history>5. Master P Receives Lowest Score on DWTS History</h3><p>On season 2, rap mogul master P stepped up to replace his injured son, Romeo Miller as a contestant on the show.&nbsp;However, the judges, and all of us at home quickly learned just how out of place he was.&nbsp;His dance partner, Ashly DelGrosso even became physically frustrated with the rapper’s lack of effort.&nbsp;</p><p>Master P earned a shocking 8 out of 40 points, the lowest all time score in the show’s history at the time.&nbsp;However, the viewers didn’t give up on him just yet, as he made it all the way to week four before getting eliminated.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-bobby-bones-wins-season-27>4. Bobby Bones Wins Season 27</h3><p>At the time, this was known as the biggest upset in Dancing with the Stars history.&nbsp;The country radio personality’s victory of the mirrorball was a huge shock given the fact that he received some of the season’s lowest scores.&nbsp;Many viewers were furious with the decision, and I think <a href=#>Bobby Bones</a> himself was surprised he won.&nbsp;There were far more deserving contestants that season, and the whole thing was more or less a fluke.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-tom-bergeron-and-erin-andrews-fired-as-hosts>3. Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews Fired as Hosts</h3><p>Perhaps one of the biggest Dancing with the Stars shocks of all time is when fans found out that <a href=#>Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews</a> were not returning as hosts.&nbsp;The surprise came to een Bergeron himself, who had been hosting the show since its debut in 2005.&nbsp;He had even received nine Emmy nominations for Outstanding Host for a Reality Competition and won back in 2012.&nbsp;His absence was truly a shame, considering the <a href=#>current host doesn’t quite match</a> Bergeron’s deep love for the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-tyra-banks-flubs-results-on-season-29>2. Tyra Banks Flubs Results on Season 29</h3><p>Last season, host <a href=#>Tyra Banks</a> called out the wrong names during a live results show.&nbsp;Due to a behind the scenes error, Banks was alerted after revealing the wrong couple in the bottom two.&nbsp;As a result, Monica Maldama and her partner Val Chmerkovskiy were asked to return to the stage.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-sasha-farber-proposes-to-emma-slater>1. Sasha Farber Proposes to Emma Slater</h3><p>In 2016, jaws dropped and tears flowed after the beautiful moment that took place on stage that season.&nbsp;Following a contemporary routine to Bruno Mars’s “Just The Way You Are,”&nbsp;Farber dropped to one knee, not in a dance move, but to propose to fellow pro dancer Emma Slater. The couple married in 2018, in front of many Dancing with the Stars alumni, and the two are still going strong today.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AlterEgo_Ep102-GG_00421.jpg alt="‘Alter Ego’s Jay Miah Decided “I Am a Yes” After ‘The Voice’ Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571pqrnKBdqbWmeZBpZKano6l6tLTOnKKippdiurC5xKerrGWWp7yuecOapZyhnpx6uLXToWStoJViwLWt0axm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
