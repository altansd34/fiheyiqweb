The country singer has remained relatively quiet since his arrest a few months back. Fans believe the singer may be back together with his ex-girlfriend due to the nature of the new track.</strong></p><p>On September 3, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laine Hardy</a> shared a video of him singing a new love song on Instagram. The song called “Me Meeting You,” is seemingly about meeting the perfect match. His ex-girlfriend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Gracie Lee</a> commented on the post, “U!!!” along with heart-eyes emoji. Prompting many fans to speculate about the possibility that the two of them are back dating again.</p><p>For those who may not remember, Hardy and Lee have previously had a on-again, off-again relationship during his American Idol season and beyond. The couple originally became Instagram official in October 2019 and was later seen in June 2021, when Hardy posted photos of them together with a thoughtful caption.</p><p>Although Hardy didn’t specify who the song was about, many believe that they may be back together. On August 21, Lee published photos of herself on a tour bus, wearing Hardy merchandise. The fellow singer liked many comments on her post, but many noticed that she noticed comments that acknowledged them as a couple.</p><p>“Hopefully Laine has finally come to his senses and realizes that he has had the right girl all along! You’re absolutely beautiful, Gracie!!” a fan wrote in a comment Lee liked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-laine-hardy-gets-arrested-for-spying-on-lsu-student>Laine Hardy Gets Arrested for Spying on LSU Student</h2><p>The country singer was arrested back in April 2022, for allegedly bugging an ex-girlfriend’s dorm room.&nbsp;Hardy was sent into East Baton Rouge Parish Prison for “interception and disclosure of wire, electronic or oral communication.” This is an offense that has a maximum fine of $10,000 and an extended prison sentence.</p><p>He released a statement at the time, saying that he was fully cooperating with authorities. Hardy stated, “I have the utmost respect for the law and will assist in their investigation as needed moving forward.”</p><p>According to the LSU school newspaper, the accuser had dated Hardy from November 2021 to February 2022. Her identity has remained anonymous to this point.</p><p>Even though Hardy was arrested at the time, he still appeared as part of American Idol‘s landmark celebration. Fans criticized the show for airing pre-recorded content of Hardy and <a href=# class=broken_link>Laci Kaye Booth</a> amid his arrest.</p><p>Hardy then went silent on social media for almost three months after that statement. This summer, Hardy returned to social media on July 25, with an acoustic song called “Party I Can Play.” Many believe that this is just the beginning for Hardy’s comeback to the country genre.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KristinCruz_AGT.jpg alt="Meet Kristen Cruz, the TikTok Star Heading to the ‘AGT’ Live Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>laine hardy</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2avmaO7pr6MpZiippVitaK%2Bw7JkrKiRp7i0ecarmJyhlWK5prGMnZitoZ6cerPBzKiprGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
