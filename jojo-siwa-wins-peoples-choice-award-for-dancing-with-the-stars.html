Although they didn’t bring home the mirrorball, she has brought home another award for her time on the series. Last night, she accepted the People’s Choice Award for The Competition Contestant of 2021.</strong></p><p>JoJo showed up to the People’s Choice Awards in a pink ruffled dress that had a rhinestone lined V-neck. She wore her hair in half-up half down pigtails and sparkly, yet natural makeup. Throughout the night, this celebrity was glowing. She looked absolutely gorgeous <a href=#>presenting</a> the People’s Choice Award for <a href=#>Daytime Talk Show of 2021 to Ellen DeGeneres</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-wins-people-s-choice-award-for-her-time-on-dancing-with-the-stars>JoJo Siwa Wins People’s Choice Award For Her Time on Dancing With the Stars</h2><p>JoJo and Jenna came in second place on Dancing With the Stars, but will still be remembered for their time as the show’s <a href=#>first same-sex couple</a>. The couple earned six perfect scores throughout the season and had people all over social media voting for them to succeed.</p><p>During the People’s Choice Awards, JoJo shared that she is honored to break barriers within the LGBTQIA+ community.</p><p>“When I had the opportunity to dance with another female immediately I knew there was no other way to do it. I knew what it would do for the world,” <a href=#>said</a> JoJo. “I knew what history I would make, and I knew what it would do for little kids at home you know who felt like maybe they were afraid to love who they wanted to love.”</p><p>JoJo has been a celebrity since her time on Dance Mom’s. She has always been extremely authentic with her fans, especially children. Earlier this year, the star came out as apart of the LGBTQIA+ community. In returned, she received nothing but love from her fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CXNjR03r9bW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>“I’ve always said love who you want to love, be who you want to be and I think that getting to dance with Jenna on Dancing With the Stars, getting to dance with another female just showed that,” <a href=#>said</a> JoJo. “We’re watching a bunch of boys and girls dancing together and they’re amazing, but watching a girl and girl dancing together is just as amazing.”</p><p>JoJo received a nomination for this award alongside fellow Dancing With the Stars alumni <a href=#>Cody Rigsby</a> and Matt James (nominated for his time on The Bachelor), as well as <a href=#>JoJo</a> and Wiz Khalifa from <a href=# class=broken_link>The Masked Singer</a>, Katie Thurston on The Bachelorette, and <a href=#>Symone from RuPaul’s Drag Race</a>.</p><p>This star shared photos of her with her People’s Choice Award on Instagram to continue the celebration.
