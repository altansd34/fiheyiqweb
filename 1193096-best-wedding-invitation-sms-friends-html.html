Keep in mind that you should be sure that the <a href=#>friends in question</a> have a good sense of humour and that they will understand the joke. Here is how to invite for a wedding with a touch of humour.</p><ul><li>My friend, you are not exactly charming or super funny, but if you come to my ceremony, the other guests will look better in comparison.</li><li>Our wedding is going to take place on (date of the big day), and (name of your future husband/wife) said that it would be alright if you came.</li><li>We invite you to our wedding and are hoping that you will come! Please consider your gift thoroughly because if we do not like it, we will have to give it back to you for your own big day.</li><li>We are taking an important step in our future life, so we just have to call you to be there for us.</li><li>So, how are we planning to make our ceremony a memorable event? We have no idea so far. But eh, come anyway.</li><li>We have been considering getting married for a while, so come along, I guess.</li><li>Our wedding ceremony will include the dance floor and the open bar, so of course, who else would get our first invitation except you?</li><li>You have always been a great friend to me, and my husband/wife-to-be is only mildly annoyed with you, so please come to our wedding!</li><li>As you know, I and my husband/wife-to-be are the perfect couples, but we sometimes think – where would we be if it was not for you? Come to our special day – and don't you dare miss it.</li><li>We appreciate the role which you have played in our lives all this time, but now you seriously must change the role. Just kidding, please come to our big day!</li><li>Come to our wedding ceremony; we will have a lot of cake there!</li><li>We have been best friends ever since we first met! Oh, and you are neat, too. Please consider coming to our big day!</li><li>Walking down the aisle will be pointless if you are not here to cheer for us and give inappropriate whistles. Come to our wedding!</li><li>You are one of these few friends that we absolutely would not tolerate any excuses. You will either come to our wedding ceremony or pay your price later.</li><li>Do you remember when you said that my future husband/wife is the one and only for me? It turns out that you knew all along! What would the wedding be now without you?</li><li>So, you get an invitation to our wedding ceremony, and in return, we will prepare for you your favourite (insert the name of a meal that your friend loves).</li><li>We are getting married, and we thought that it would only be fair if you were at our ceremony!</li><li>Join us for the best moments of our life by coming to our wedding day! Oh yeah, we forgot to mention there will be a lot of booze.</li><li>What can be better than booze, cake, and the entertainment of your best friend getting all sweaty before the marriage? Right, nothing can. Be there for our big day and get all these privileges first-hand!</li><li>Without you, none of this would ever have happened. Thank you for everything you have done for us! I want to ask you for something more – give me the honour of being there for us at the celebration of our endless love.</li><li>It was you who made our union happen. Now, you just must be there to suffer through the ceremony!</li><li>You can drink a lot of booze at our wedding and show your best dance moves. So basically, this would be just another party for you. But we would love to see you there on our special day!</li><li>We are eagerly waiting to see you at our ceremony and, of course, opening your gift.</li><li>You are invited to our big day, and we want to say. Just be the heck there, man!</li><li>Our wedding bells are ringing, and a great gift you will be bringing!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5b89082b56125f94.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ sweet happy 21st birthday wishes, messages and quotes</span></p></a><h3>Unique marriage invitation message on WhatsApp</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/87eb705806c5dc04.jpg><p class=align-left>While some people will go for the tried and tested wedding invitations, you can choose to send some unique wedding invitation wordings for friends.

Please, come here and be with me on this exciting day!</li><li>This moment is the most significant moment of our lives, and we invited 30 very special people to be here on our big day. You were the 31st.</li><li>So, I asked her to be my wife, and she replied yes. Long story short, now we have to throw a wedding. And what is a wedding without plenty of guests?</li><li>Our new life is about to start, and who else would we want to cheer us up along the way? Of course, you are the incredible person! You are invited to our wedding!</li><li>The only circumstances that can make our big day even better are if we have our best friend as a guest at our wedding.</li><li>Two things will make us incredibly happy on the day of our wedding. The first one is our actual ceremony, and the second one is you being here for us.</li><li>Our dream is to spend the rest of our life together, but of course, we need people who mean a lot to us to witness the beginning of our married life.</li><li>Do you remember your promise to give me a wonderful gift for my wedding? Well, I still remember it!</li><li>We cannot even comprehend the idea of you not being a guest at our wedding, so just write down the date and remember to come!</li><li>The path of true love has led us to each other, and the path to booze and delicious food will lead you to our big day.</li><li>With honours, we would like to invite you; wait, who cares about the formalities? This is our wedding, you are our friend, and you must be there!</li><li>We have great news for you – we will get married soon! Now, even more great news – you are invited to our wedding! And the not-so-great news – if you miss our ceremony, you are so going to pay the price.</li><li>Come to our wedding and dance the night away, like you always do!</li><li>No excuses, friend! You are going to be there on the day when we give each other our hearts and souls.</li><li>We know that our public display of affection can sometimes be too much for you, but just one last time, we are asking you to attend our ceremony.</li><li>Come over for the weekend. You will have something to eat and a lot to drink, and you will casually witness a wedding. Now, guess whose is it?</li><li>Our love has gone through a lot of things, but one thing has always been constant, and this was you. We are excited to see you at our wedding!</li><li>Next month we are going to make a first step towards our "happily ever after", and we wanted you to share this moment with us!</li><li>We are anticipating the big day of our life, so we wanted to let important people know how much they mean to us. You were on top of our list!</li><li>You like DJs, booze, and buffet, right? Then come to our wedding, all these things will be under one roof. By roof, we mean the wide starry sky!</li><li>What more could a person ask for a wedding than the three F: family, friends, and fun? Be there or be square!</li><li>We will have our ceremony at the grand place, but it would surely not be so grand if you were not here with us.</li><li>We only want people we truly love to share our happiness with us on our <a href=#>special day</a>, and therefore, we want to invite you.</li><li>On our special day, our lives will change forever.
