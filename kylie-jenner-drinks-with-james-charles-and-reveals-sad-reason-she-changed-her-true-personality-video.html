This time, they cracked open a bottle of wine. They discussed everything from their Halloween plans to Kylie’s personality and how she would like to show it more. They also spoke about rare moments where she is able to be herself on camera.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kylie Jenner Opened Up To James Charles About Showing Her True Self</h2><p>James and Kylie’s last Halloween video was actually two years ago so this one is long overdue. James asked Kylie what her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween plans</a> are and she said her daughter Stormi is very excited for the holiday.</p><p>Though the coronavirus pandemic has impacted their ability to go trick or treating, Kylie and Kim decided to do something fun for the kids in the backyard. She also adorably gushed about how Stormi wants to be a minion for Halloween. Needless to say, Halloween is a big deal in the Kardashian/Jenner family.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>DID KYLIE JENNER REALLY CALL HERSELF A ‘BROWN SKINNED GIRL’ IN INSTAGRAM POST?</a></strong></p><p>James applied Kylie’s makeup using a combination of latex to give off some special effects and her new cheetah collection for Kylie Cosmetics. They launched into talking about a recent clip from Keeping Up With The Kardashians where people fell in love with Kylie after she sang a song about getting wasted. James said it was nice to see Kylie’s true personality on television because she is very nice and friendly in person.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“I think I showed my personality like my true personality for so long on Vine, and as I got bigger and bigger I just realized like when people used to say mean things about how I really am and my personality, it would hurt me more than almost playing a character like not showing people everything,” she said. She proceeded to say she started doing a little less which is sad.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kylie Also Said She Wants More Children</h3><p>Shifting gears from the conversation about Kylie’s personality, she also said that she wants more children “so bad.” But she does not have a timeline about when she wants to have another kid. She has had more free time recently after announcing that Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be ending in 2021. She called it “the end of a chapter.”</p><p>Kylie said that she tries to mix having fun and planning content when she goes on vacations. James commented on how Kylie is always posting some awesome Instagram content in various locations all over the world.</p><p>Kylie is a workhorse and hinted at having “a lot planned” about what’s next for her in the future. James continued to work on Kylie’s cheetah makeup look and it honestly ended up looking stunning. The pair posed for an Instagram picture after their highly-anticipated collaboration.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CG3C1c1HvWH/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TWITTER DRAGS KYLIE JENNER FOR NOT TAGGING A BLACK-OWNED BRAND ON INSTAGRAM</a></strong></p><p>What did you think of James and Kylie’s latest makeup collaboration using her new cheetah collection?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Voice-Ben-Allen-Blake-Shelton.jpeg alt="Incredible Country Singer Is Blake Shelton’s Twin On ‘The Voice’ — Meet Ben Allen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>James Charles</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>kylie jenner</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yrKjop1dn7KvusSrZJ2qmaO4tHnWoquhZZqWuqa%2FjJyfmqqcmsBurc2dZKudppqurb%2BMrJidZaKarrS7zWaqoZ1dmLWiusaem2aglad6tb7UnmSpnaKovK%2Bty6KrsmWmnrGmu44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
