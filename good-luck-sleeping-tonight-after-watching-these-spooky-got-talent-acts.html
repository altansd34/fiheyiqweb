I’m one to get frightened easy, but I’m sure I’ll be seeing these contestants tonight in my dreams. Watch the spooky acts if you dare!</strong></p><p>These six acts are some of the most terrifying things you’ll see. I’m talking possessed girls, nerve racking daredevils and contortionists that’ll make you cringe. Happy Halloween Talent Recap fans, here are six of the spookiest Got Talent acts. You might want to sleep with the lights on tonight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-the-sacred-riana>1. The Sacred Riana</h2><p>This list had to begin with the most well known terrifying act of all time, <a href=#>The Sacred Riana</a>. She freaked the judges and audience out when she had Mel B. say who caused a tragic fire. Mel B. was terrified when the person she chose was actually the person who started the fire. I’m with her on this one, this act really freaked me out.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Klek Entos</h2><p>The moment Klek Entos stepped on stage during the last season of <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a>, we knew something was up. Lights were flickering, the background of the stage was changing and the judges were immediately spooked. Klek quickly became a fan-favorite in the competition because his creepy magic gave everyone chills.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/jWJfhyJFcog</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Aaron Crow</h2><p>Aaron Crow took to the <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> stage completely mute. He showed off his terrifying knife skills in what seemed to be a normal audition, until he picked volunteers out of the audience, and Howie Mandel to come on stage. Mandel’s heart definitely skipped a beat on stage. The daredevil poured hot wax into his eyes and aimed his sword for the pineapple on the comedians head.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Elizabeth</h2><p>Elizabeth’s <a href=#>Britain’s Got Talent</a> performance began in a similar light flickering fashion like Klek Entos AGT audition. The contestant took Amanda on stage with her after handing her a journal at the judges panel. She told the audience about how the studio they’re in his haunted then took Amanda underneath the stage. This act was so spooky that I needed to click off of this video. If I were Amanda, I would’ve freaked out too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/f4CqT03Ri1I</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Miki Dark</h2><p>Miki Dark shocked the <a href=# class=broken_link>America’s Got Talent: The Champions</a> audience when he pointed at Heidi Klum and Terry Crews to join him on the fire filled stage. This contestant took out a picture of Simon Cowell and ripped its eye off. He had Crews and Klum create distractions, and while he threw a knife at a moving piece of paper. The audience got goosebumps when the piece of paper was the picture of Cowell’s printed eye.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Strauss Serpent</h2><p>We’ll leave you with a not-so-scary act just so you can try to sleep easy tonight. This video is more disturbing than it is scary. Strauss Serpent is the most flexible person we’ve ever seen on a Got Talent stage. His act was absolutely mind boggling and probably lives in many people’s nightmares. How does he do that?!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/160964_2529-1.jpg alt="The ‘Dancing with the Stars’ Relays Start this Week, Here’s What to Expect" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xqimnWWcqrCsedKlnJ6omaO0bsDOp6CgoKRirqfAxKtksJmkmLWqusZmq6Gdo5p6tLzOqKKyZZekwW7AwKWcp6xdlrC1v44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
