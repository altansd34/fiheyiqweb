We were all sitting in the backstage room, and the director was telling us about the show we were doing, the parts, etc. There was one kid who was being really obnoxious. He just would not stay in his seat and he would not be quiet! He would just start talking and interrupt people and then get up and walk around the room. Eventually the director (Who I had known for years and was a very kind man) said "Max, if you can't stay in that chair I'm going to have to duct-tape you to it". Max sat back in the chair, but about 3 minutes later he started talking and walking around again. Our director stood up, opened a cabinet, and started looking through it. Everyone started whispering "He's getting the duct tape, he's getting the duct tape!". He came back with a flowered apron, the kind you just tie around your waist. He tied it around max and the chair so max was tied to the chair! Of course it was very loose and only tied in a bow so Max could easily untie it. Even though it was kind of rude, it was funny to all of us, even Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecinqqmhop67qHnSraaroZWoeqKuzq6rZqiVpL2tsYywn6hlkaeybsDEmpqhnaKoeqPFjKeYra2imnp5fJBpb29n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
