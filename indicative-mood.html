The indicative mood is used to express statements of fact and to ask questions in English. The overwhelming majority of verbs are in the indicative mood in English and you will see them in declarative and interrogative sentences. Confused? Let’s simplify this and learn more about the indicative mood.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-the-indicative-mood?>What is the indicative mood?</h2><p>First, what is a ‘mood’? A grammatical mood is how the main verb in a clause is used and how it gives meaning to a sentence. There are three major grammatical moods in English:</p><li>The indicative mood: Jake <strong>told</strong> me.&nbsp;</li><li>The subjunctive mood: If I <strong>were</strong> Jake, I would tell you.</li><li>The imperative mood: <strong>Tell</strong> me now, Jake!&nbsp;</li><p>We are focusing on the indicative mood, which is a verb form we use in declarative sentences. The indicative mood is by far the most common mood in English and it is the only realis mood. The realis mood is used when we want to express that something is real or true.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-the-indicative-mood>When to use the indicative mood</h2><p>You can use the indicative mood in any <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tense</a>, past, present, or future. It is used when you make statements of fact and opinion and when you ask <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">questions</a>. You almost certainly already know how to make statements and ask questions in English, so you’re already using the indicative mood. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>What is your name? – My name is Helena.&nbsp;</li><li>What do you think the weather will be like tonight? – I think it will rain.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Present tenses</h3><p>Here are examples of sentences in the indicative mood in the present simple and continuous, and the <a href=#>present perfect</a> simple and continuous.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The stars <strong>are</strong> very visible tonight.</li><li>We <strong>are walking</strong> to work.&nbsp;</li><li>They <strong>haven’t eaten</strong> yet.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Have</strong> you <strong>been jogging</strong>?</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Past tenses</h3><p>Now we have some example sentences in the indicative mood in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">past simple and continuous</a>, and in the past perfect simple and continuous.</p><ul><li>We <strong>went</strong> to the gym.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Was </strong>he <strong>cycling</strong> to work?&nbsp;</li><li>I <strong>had</strong> never <strong>liked</strong> running until I started going with a friend.</li><li>I <strong>had been wanting</strong> to go there for a long time.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Future tenses</h3><p>Finally, here are some example sentences in the <a href=#>future</a> tenses.</p><ul><li><strong>Will </strong>Marco <strong>help</strong>?&nbsp;</li><li>She <strong>will be</strong> <strong>coming</strong> later.&nbsp;</li><li>Pete <strong>will have worked </strong>there for 20 years in June.&nbsp;</li><li>By the time I finish my book, I <strong>will have been writing </strong>it for over a year.</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The subjunctive and imperative moods</h2><p>While the indicative mood is by far the most common in English, the subjunctive and imperative moods are used often too. Here’s a quick overview of these moods.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Subjunctive mood</h3><p>This mood is used to express wishes, doubts, or imaginary situations.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I suggested that he <strong>cycle</strong> to work.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This is not a fact, it is a suggestion. Notice that it is “he <strong>cycle</strong>”, not “he cycles”.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Imperative mood</h3><p>The imperative mood is used to express commands or requests.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Pick that up, right now!</li><li>Please don’t open the window.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Using the indicative mood</h2><p>Now that you’re more aware of the different moods in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, and much more familiar with the indicative mood, your speaking and writing should be more precise. Remember, you likely already use the indicative mood in most of your English sentences as, most of the time, we talk about facts and make statements about real situations.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
