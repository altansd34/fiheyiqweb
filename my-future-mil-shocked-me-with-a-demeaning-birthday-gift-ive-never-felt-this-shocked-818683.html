However, it's widely acknowledged that conflicts, especially with mothers-in-law, can arise, dampening the excitement of the occasion. Recently, a Reddit user sought solace and advice from the online <a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a> while navigating strained relations with her mother-in-law during this journey.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>:</p><p>"This woman is so... I have no words, honestly. I'm in shock, I haven't even told my <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> or close friends. I'm just speechless. Google brought me here, and I've read a few posts and seen a lot of amazing advice, but I haven't seen anything that relates to my predicament. I haven't shown or spoken to my fiancé yet because he's travelling for work.</p><p>This woman does not like me, she hasn't said it, but it's clear she doesn't. For example, I have a three letter name, yet she refers to me using my fiancé's exes names which are much longer than mine. She did this until he noticed what she was doing and called her out on it.</p><p>Her excuse? She's old. She's in her early 50s. She's so subtle and passive-aggressive that sometimes it takes me a while to get what she really means."</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went on explaining</a>:</p><p>"For context, I come from a middle class family, while my fiancé's family is very wealthy. Anyways, at the surprise party my fiancé threw me, she winked at me and said, 'Your gift is coming later in the mail.'<strong> </strong>I was devastated to see it was a prenup! No one in my family has ever had to sign a prenup.</p><p>I looked up some of the terms and sent some pages to my coworker who's married to a lawyer, and he called me to tell me not to sign it, he referred to it as "extremely aggressive". There are things like, 'I agree to no <a href=# title=spousal data-link=tag>spousal</a> support in case of divorce' and then a weird infidelity penalty. And the craziest bit I've read so far was about me having to spend time with FMIL and the rest of my future in-laws.</p><p>She knows I've got it, because she called me 100 times since the mail courier delivered it a few hours ago. I honestly don't know what to say. I have no problem signing a prenup if that is what my fiancé wants. Although, I doubt he knows because he asked FMIL what she got me, and she grinned and said, "You'll see."</p><p>But this one has been referred to as 'extremely unfair and dehumanizing' by a lawyer. I get this is what rich people do, but getting it from your FMIL is weird, right? Or is it a normal thing, and I'm overreacting? And now, FMIL sent me a message, basically telling me to sign and get it out of the way, so we can start wedding planning."</p><p><h2>Other Redditors chimed in to support her and offered their advice, leaving comments such as:</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecWuq66qlWK6qriMrJ%2Bom5uasW65xGauoqyYYq5usMSmnJqmmaO0bq7Iq6uhnJGueqi1xa1koq6VYrumwsSrZJ%2BdnKl6tbTIrGSsoJ%2BYuKawjHFocW5oaHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
