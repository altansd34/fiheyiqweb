Any couple has many things in&nbsp;common, and some even have similar facial features. But there are couples who look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they are brother and sister.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have also noticed this tendency, and we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;find out what scientists think about this interesting phenomenon. Who knows? Maybe there is&nbsp;someone out there for everyone. A&nbsp;heartwarming <strong>bonus</strong> at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article will prove that true <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> can never be&nbsp;forgotten.</p><p><h2>Resembling our parents</h2></p><p>They say that a&nbsp;man tends to&nbsp;marry his mother. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;more likely that his wife will share some close similarities with his mother, both in&nbsp;habit and appearance. Scientists <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confirm</a> that we&nbsp;choose <strong>partners who not only look like&nbsp;us but also like our opposite-sex parent</strong>. The most significant factors here are hair and eye color, and the age of&nbsp;our parents.</p><p><h2>Number of&nbsp;years spent together</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e7/184/6c62625124920edd4b03823a2b.jpg><p>MCMULLAN CO/East News<span>, </span>Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>Robert Zajonc, a&nbsp;social psychologist, compared photographs of&nbsp;couples from before they got married with those taken 25&nbsp;years later. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>His study</a> showed that even if&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband and wife had no&nbsp;facial similarities at&nbsp;all, some 25&nbsp;years later they looked surprisingly alike.</p><p><h2>Sharing experiences</h2></p><p>Another reason for eventually starting to&nbsp;look like each other is&nbsp;<a href=#>sharing experiences with your partner</a>. Throughout their life together, a&nbsp;couple experiences a&nbsp;great deal of&nbsp;happy and sad moments. Everything they go&nbsp;through together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple affects their body language and emotional state. Their history is&nbsp;“written” on&nbsp;their faces: <strong>even a&nbsp;couple’s wrinkles form in&nbsp;the same places.</strong></p><p><h2>We’re attracted to&nbsp;people who look like&nbsp;us.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f53/147/5f206b50caa0b94dbcb71cb803.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>studies</a>, we’re attracted to&nbsp;those who share facial similarities with&nbsp;us. It’s called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>assortative mating</a>, a&nbsp;theory suggesting that individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently. If&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;you look alike, <strong>chances are your child will look a&nbsp;lot like both of&nbsp;you. </strong>Scientists believe this is&nbsp;how <strong>individuals try to&nbsp;maximize passing on&nbsp;their genes to&nbsp;the next generation.</strong></p><p><h2>Similar immune systems</h2></p><p>Our <strong><a href=# title="immune system" data-link=tag>immune system</a> reflects our lifestyle,</strong> including our eating habits and physical exercise. A&nbsp;group of&nbsp;scientists <a href=#>concluded</a> that couples who had been married for a&nbsp;long time have very similar immune systems. Maybe that’s why 2&nbsp;partners often share their habits and lifestyle in&nbsp;general.</p><p><h2>Mirroring</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80c/766/3996885d6094655f530ec60f0d.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>Couples who are in&nbsp;tune with each other often <strong>mirror </strong>each other’s habits and body language. It&nbsp;shows that there’s <a href=#>emotional comfort and trust</a> in&nbsp;their relationship. Scientists <a href=#>state</a> that partners tend to&nbsp;change their own habits throughout their married life. For example, if&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them was trying to&nbsp;quit smoking and started eating healthy food, the other one often did the same.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Despite all the differences and similarities, the best thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;keep falling in&nbsp;love with your special someone over and over again.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a16/044/a4fb86515c97fcf7a08c2b1cd1.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;grandparents’ 60th wedding anniversary. My&nbsp;grandfather had Alzheimer’s. He&nbsp;didn’t remember his children, his home, or&nbsp;anything else. But, as&nbsp;bad as&nbsp;it&nbsp;got, whenever he&nbsp;saw my&nbsp;grandmother he&nbsp;would say, ’Look at&nbsp;my&nbsp;beautiful wife!’”</p><p><strong>And do&nbsp;you and your loved one look alike?
