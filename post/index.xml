Being able to&amp;nbsp;stand in&amp;nbsp;someone else’s shoes, understand them, and care for them is&amp;nbsp;not a&amp;nbsp;weakness, but perhaps the strongest trait of&amp;nbsp;all which also keeps your brain healthy.
Bright Side truly believes in&amp;nbsp;the power of&amp;nbsp;kindness and would like to&amp;nbsp;expand on&amp;nbsp;why kind people are often the smartest of&amp;nbsp;all.
Kind people have healthier brains.
According to&amp;nbsp;research done by&amp;nbsp;famous neuroscientist Richard Davidson, kindness makes brains healthy. Teaching kids and adolescents to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;kind can increase their academic performance and emotional well-being.</description></item><item><title>'America's Got Talent' Las Vegas Live Show to Close This Year</title><link>/americas-got-talent-las-vegas-live-show-to-close-this-year.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/americas-got-talent-las-vegas-live-show-to-close-this-year.html</guid><description>TALENTRECAP.COM Talent America's Got Talent

Also, different regions of&amp;nbsp;the world have their own beauty standards and their own methods of&amp;nbsp;skin care.

Halloween ideas changed with time and so&amp;nbsp;did the costumes that have evolved from pagan animal skins to&amp;nbsp;grotesque and creepy masks of&amp;nbsp;the 20th century and modern costumes of&amp;nbsp;fairy tale villains and superheroes.
Here at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side we&amp;nbsp;want to&amp;nbsp;show you a&amp;nbsp;collection of&amp;nbsp;vintage Halloween costumes from the last century and a&amp;nbsp;bonus picture of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;modern costume that looks as&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;came to&amp;nbsp;us from the past.</description></item><item><title>What is Bryan Cranston's net worth in 2024?

This can refer to&amp;nbsp;both literary characters and real-life personalities. For example, Miss Marple, Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II, and Cleopatra are very popular among film directors.
At&amp;nbsp;Bright Side, we&amp;nbsp;decided to&amp;nbsp;recall the actors who embodied the same characters. But it’s only the viewers who can choose which actor was better in&amp;nbsp;this part.
1. Miss Marple
Joan Hickson
Miss Marple is&amp;nbsp;loved by&amp;nbsp;many filmmakers. This Agatha Christie character was embodied by&amp;nbsp;Helen Hayes (A&amp;nbsp;Caribbean Mystery, 1983, and Murder with Mirrors, 1985), Joan Hickson (Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple, 1984-1992), and Geraldine McEwan (Marple, 2004-2008).</description></item><item><title>20Pictures ofAnimals That Can Cheer Anyone Up</title><link>/20-pictures-of-animals-that-can-cheer-anyone-up-443260.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/20-pictures-of-animals-that-can-cheer-anyone-up-443260.html</guid><description>When you're in bad mood and you think there is not a single reason to be happy, it's just necessary to notice something cute and funny.
