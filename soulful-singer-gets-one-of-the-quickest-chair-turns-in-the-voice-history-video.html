He managed to get out the first line of the song “This is a man’s world” before Nick Jonas and John Legend pressed their buttons in record time. The pair turned their chairs so quickly, it took a second to process what just happened. John stood up on his feet dancing as Mike’s performance was full of soul.</p><p>It took one high note to turn coach Kelly Clarkson’s chair.
