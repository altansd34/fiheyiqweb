She spent most of&nbsp;her early life in&nbsp;<a href=#>a&nbsp;trailer park</a> in&nbsp;Bellingham, Washington. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15, Hilary Swank<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> left school </a>to&nbsp;pursue acting. While some of&nbsp;her teachers were supportive, others discouraged her, causing her to&nbsp;drop out. Later&nbsp;on, in&nbsp;1990, her parents got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorced.</a> With no&nbsp;place to&nbsp;live and little money, Hilary and her mother moved to&nbsp;California to&nbsp;pursue her acting career.</p><p>Mother and daughter were initially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>homeless</a> and slept in&nbsp;their car for several weeks before a&nbsp;friend offered them a&nbsp;vacant house to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;at&nbsp;night. Despite their lack of&nbsp;furniture, they slept on&nbsp;air mattresses and left in&nbsp;the morning to&nbsp;give the friend space to&nbsp;sell the house. Eventually, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;her resilience and hard work, she ended up&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;TV shows in&nbsp;the early 1990s, which ultimately led to&nbsp;her success in&nbsp;the entertainment industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e7/1c6/904f1a5b3485da57cf3e4f3e90.jpg><p>Furthermore, Hilary landed her breakout role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>transgender boy</a> in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Boys Don’t Cry</i></a>, which earned her an&nbsp;Oscar.
