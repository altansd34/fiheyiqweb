They competed on Croatia’s Got Talent in 2019. Their routine was hard-hitting and fast-paced but they managed to execute it perfectly. Check out their audition below and prepare to be amazed.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABvFKE-nq-k</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dance-crew-no-shame-brought-hard-hitting-moves-to-croatia-s-got-talent>Dance Crew No Shame Brought Hard-Hitting Moves To ‘Croatia’s Got Talent’</h2><p>Dance group No Shame started their routine off right away with some power. The trio are all best friends and their special bond with each other really translated well on stage. They have had a ton of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>previous experience</a> performing in dance competitions and shows like Mamma Mia! so they were no strangers to large audiences.</p><p>They had just the right amount of swagger and their coordinated outfits really popped on stage. One thing that made their performance even better was the master-mix of music that they performed to. It really got the crowd and the judges into the performance and had everyone waiting to see what moves they would do next.</p><p>The judges praised them for their routine and the fact that they all managed to be completely in sync with each other during each and every move. No Shame was sent into the next round of the competition. This next routine was full of energy and No Shame wore matching black leather outfits as they worked the stage. Each group member had a chance to shine and the routine even started off very dramatically with a little help from the production team.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JUDGE MOVED TO JOIN FIERCE VIETNAMESE DANCERS ON STAGE DURING ‘ASIA’S GOT TALENT’ AUDITION</a></strong></p><p>Though No Shame was later eliminated from the competition, they definitely set the standard for dance crews on Croatia’s Got Talent. “I am grateful to have such good people by my side” group member Valentina wrote on Instagram after competing on the show. “They say that friends are the family you choose, and I know that you are mine.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_VC0TpYhU4</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-are-they-now>Where Are They Now?</h3><p>After competing on Croatia’s Got Talent, No Shame has not really been posting on their Instagram page very much. However, group member Valentina continues to post on her own Instagram account and is a choreographer and dance instructor. She posted this awesome combination that shows just why No Shame was such a hit when they appeared on Croatia’s Got Talent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CH47qsnJ2Lh/</p></figure><p>Group member David has also been posting on his own personal Instagram account and looks like he has been having some fun in the sun. Valentina and David actually did some choreography together along with a few friends. They held a workshop where they both came up with the choreography for their studio called Plesni Studio Fusion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CA4oOVApQiG/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH DANCERS PERFORM INCREDIBLE ROUTINE ON ‘AGT’ INSPIRED BY VERY POPULAR VIDEO GAME</a></strong></p><p>What did you think of No Shame’s audition on Croatia’s Got Talent?
