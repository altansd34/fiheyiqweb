The Prime Minister estimated that it would cost ‘well north of a pound’, but explained that he didn’t know very well because he preferred to use a bread maker. The radio presenter interviewing Cameron said the real price was 47p.</p><p>Far from being alone in his ignorance, Cameron is actually joined by 68% of the British public: in a new survey only a third (32%) were able to guess that the cost of a ‘value loaf of white bread’ is between 41p and 60p. A larger group, comprising 34% of the public, guessed that the number was somewhere over 80p. 8% guess it costs less than 40p, and 12% admit they don’t know.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Loaf20of20Bread20Chart.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The average estimate was 67p.</p><p>Though the wide range of estimates suggests Foreign Secretary William Hague may have been onto something when he said that questions about the cost of common supermarket items, a decades-old measure for how 'in touch' policians are with their voters, may be out of date.</p><p>He <a href=#>told</a> BBC Radio 4: 'It's a bit of a 1960s question. <span>After all, what is the price of a loaf of bread these days? </span>There are many different prices depending on what you want.'</p><p>Image: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full poll results</strong></a></p><p class=title><a href=#>Join YouGov today!
