Fully 85% of Britons say this is a good idea, with only 9% branding it the wrong priority for the present time.</p><p data-block-key=26gdf>Three quarters (78%) back increasing the station pension in line with wages – unsurprisingly, the over-65s are especially keen, at 91%.</p><p data-block-key=8mpac>Six in ten Britons say that increasing welfare benefits in line with inflation is a good idea (64%) and a similar number say the same of the National Insurance reduction (61%).</p><p data-block-key=4jros>Conservative voters are less likely to approve of the uprating of welfare benefits than their Labour counterparts (54% vs 76%). Despite being predominantly of working age, Labour voters are less likely to approve of the NI cut than Tory voters (54% vs 72%).</p><p data-block-key=5fk3j>Six in ten Britons also say compulsory work placements for those who have been out of work for 18 months are a good idea (60%).</p><p data-block-key=4qkah>The unglamorous proposal to allow “full expensing” for businesses – meaning they will be able to claim money they spend on IT, machinery or equipment back against tax – gains plurality support, with 43% calling it a good idea compared to 34% who think it is the wrong priority.</p><p data-block-key=9l6sh>By contrast, freezing tax on alcohol at current levels tends to be unpopular, with 47% saying that doing so is the wrong priority, and only 38% thinking it is a good idea.</p><h3 data-block-key=jj5dp id="britons-don't-think-the-autumn-statement-will-make-much-difference">Britons don’t think the Autumn Statement will make much difference</h3><p data-block-key=1kjds>Thinking about the Autumn Statement as a whole, Britons tend to see it as fair (38%) rather than not fair (23%).</p><p data-block-key=24fa9>They are divided 31-29% on whether or not it is affordable, however, and the general view is that it won’t make much different to the country (48%) or respondents’ own household finances (55%). This perception is shared equally by Conservative and Labour voters.</p><h3 data-block-key=09jxz>The public’s economic outlook remains gloomy</h3><p data-block-key=ck0bh>Britons continue to have a negative opinion of the state of the economy, and the government’s stewardship of it.</p><p data-block-key=3tkll>Seven in ten (69%) say the economy is in a bad state, while only 19% consider it ‘neither good nor bad’ and just 7% believing it to be good. Almost two thirds think the government is managing the economy badly (64%) – just a quarter say they are doing well (26%).</p><p data-block-key=ed19m>These figures are virtually identical to when we previously asked in March, following the Budget.</p><p data-block-key=bvku7>Economic expectations for the future are marginally improved, however, although still lacklustre.</p><p data-block-key=fm24n>The number of Britons who think the economy will get worse over the next 12 months has dropping eight points since March to 48%. However, there has been no change in the number expecting things to actually improve (18%), with a marginal increase in expectations that the economic situation will stay about the same (up four points to 24%).</p><p data-block-key=5ksar>There has likewise been a ten point decline in the expectation that Britons’ own household finances will get worse over the next 12 months (to 41%). This has largely been mirrored by an increase in the number who expect their finances to stay the same (up seven points to 37%), while few expect things to improve for themselves and their family (14%).</p><h3 data-block-key=9th2c id=how-is-jeremy-hunt-doing-as-chancellor>How is Jeremy Hunt doing as chancellor?</h3><p data-block-key=1rmao>Britons remain largely disengaged from Jeremy Hunt’s job performance, with 45% answering “don’t know” when asked whether he is doing a good or bad job as chancellor of the exchequer.</p><p data-block-key=fnlkj>One in five (22%) think he is doing a good job, while 33% think he is doing poorly. Those who voted for the Conservatives at the last election think he is doing well by 43% to 20%, while Labour voters think he is doing badly by 8% to 51%.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGyGdYGMsJ%2BarF2ZtqV506GcZqill7mqr4ymmKSdXaSzbsDHnmRraGJoeqLB066kp2Wjqa61scyepa0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
