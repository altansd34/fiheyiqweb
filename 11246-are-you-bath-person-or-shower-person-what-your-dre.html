What your dream home says about you</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><h3>A new YouGov survey of tastes in interior design reveals some striking details about the nation's property tastes</h3><p>Anyone who has had dealings with estate agents in the past few years will have come across the same phrases: “neutral shades”, “open plan living area”, “period features"... But where do national tastes really lie? What would the nation’s dream home really look like?</p><p>We tested some of the key choices in interior design by asking what people’s dream home would look like, and found some striking results.</p><p>First, on the question of layout, you might have presumed that the fashion for “open plan living” that seems to be the hallmark of every new Grand Design has become a popular standard. Not so. An overwhelming majority (74%) of people would prefer “a separate kitchen to living room” than “one big space, with the kitchen as part of the open plan area” (19%). The open plan option is somewhat more popular among the youngest generation of 18-24 year olds (30%) but even among this group it is not preferred.</p><p>In terms of overall style, it seems here too we are a mostly traditional people. Significantly more people would choose “a lovely old building, with period features” (48%) over “a lovely modern architect-designed building” (38%). On this issue, however, there is a striking gender divide. Women strongly prefer a traditional décor (55% to 32%), but if they had it their way men would actually prefer to live in the modern style (43% to 41%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Typeof20Home.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>On the overall colour scheme, the national preference is clear, and explains the dominance of neutral colour schemes in rental properties across the country. 72% of people would decorate their dream home in “neutral shades”, while only 17% prefer to live surrounded by “vibrant colours”. Younger generations are more likely to have an appetite for vibrant colour, but even among 18-24 year olds it is the less popular option.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/HomeColours.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>But it is on the issue of whether, in your dream bathroom, you would prefer “a big walk-in shower with no bath” or “a bath that you can shower in” that the country is most evenly divided. 47% of the country would choose the bath, 43% the shower. Perhaps surprisingly, younger people (who you might expect to be more impatient and keen for a quick shower in the morning) most strongly wish for a bath, while the oldest generation would choose a walk-in shower. It may be that mobility and the potential hazards of getting in and out of the bath eventually trump comfort.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/BathShower.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>At the time of writing, there were 19,235 properties for sale in England on the Zoopla website including the description “period features” and 43,148 including “open plan living”.</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpYWeBd3nAq5xmsZ%2BqeqOt06FkqZ2iqLyvec6rZKygn6yys3nPnqmsp55ixKmt02awqK2iYrGzsQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
