However, White said she and Cannon were “about to start in vitro” at the time.</p><p>She shared that people thought she was “this homewrecker,” and she was “bullied for months.” White said she had spoken to Cannon, and he promised to “right his wrongs” about how he handled things. However, she added, “He has yet to do that.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>, Cannon spoke to Lee this week, calling White “my muse” and saying she’s “overcome so much.” He added, “When she shared that, when it comes to any of the mothers of my children, those types of things — as someone who has lost a child, especially when you’re dealing with a mother, there’s no age or stage where you can say what their emotions should be when losing that child.”</p><p>As for what she said about the situation after her miscarriage, Cannon shared, “Because of the power of the media and who I am in the media, she felt like there was a narrative that — that they say about all the mothers of my children — all of this low-frequency negativity.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cannon-takes-full-accountability-for-the-situation>Cannon Takes ‘Full Accountability’ for the Situation</h2><p>Cannon added that he takes “full accountability” for the public’s misconceptions about White, adding, “I want her to share her true and honest story at any time. These women will tell their story … when they’re ready to do it. I want that.”</p><p>“I don’t want to ever speak for any of them,” Cannon said of the women he’s been with, “because I know they can speak for themselves. Even in times of pain, even in times of darkness, I’m leaning on them.”</p><p>Cannon has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcomed 12 children</a> with six different women over the years. Recently, Howie Mandel asked if Cannon is done having kids, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to which he responded</a>, “I guess… yeah? I don’t wanna say yeah, and then, like, you know, it’s the reproductive system… it could happen at any time.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_MB14_Ant_Dec_viaTwitter-220x147.jpeg alt="‘BGT’ Fans Criticize Ant and Dec’s Golden Buzzer Professional Beatboxer MB14" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Nick Cannon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWTlruvu81mqpqxo2K1pr%2BMrKuipJxitq95y6itnmWnnsGpecmeqqyhk5Z6uLTIrZxmp6Cau7R51KlkmpqfqsFuucismpqqop6uqLGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
