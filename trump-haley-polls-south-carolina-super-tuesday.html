Nikki Haley is vowing to continue her campaign against front-runner Donald Trump at least through the Super Tuesday contests in early March, but state-level Morning Consult surveys suggest that’s a fool’s errand.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">According to the latest tracking of the GOP nomination race in 23 states, including Haley’s home state of South Carolina, Trump is lapping his competition across the board. The Jan. 23-Feb. 4 surveys, which were conducted after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his campaign and endorsed Trump, suggest the former president already has at least one hand —&nbsp;and maybe two —&nbsp;on the party’s nomination.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Let’s start with South Carolina, where Trump leads Haley 68% to 31% among potential Republican primary voters, which includes any registered voter in the state who said they plan to vote in the state’s upcoming Feb. 24 Republican primary. It’s a gap far outside the survey’s margin of error of 5 percentage points, and suggests Haley is heading toward a shellacking in her own backyard.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Unfortunately for Haley, our data suggests things will only get worse as she heads toward Super Tuesday on March 5, when conservatives in many states across the country look primed to head to the polls and deliver a resounding victory for Trump.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Of the Super Tuesday states we’re tracking, Haley looks best-positioned to garner support in Massachusetts and North Carolina, at 28% and 23%. But it appears inconceivable that she would score a victory even there: Trump leads her by 41 points in the Bay State among potential GOP primary voters, and by an even larger 54-point margin in the Tar Heel State.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s a familiar refrain in states located further down the calendar for the Republican nomination race. From Arizona to Wisconsin — with Florida, Georgia and Ohio in between — at least three-quarters of potential Republican primary voters in each state say they plan to vote for Trump in their state’s nominating contest.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>What it means for 2024</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The wealthy Republican donors who continue to bankroll Haley’s campaign appear to be just as well off setting their cash on fire. The only thing left to do in this race is count the votes, which are sure to show Trump with a lot compared to Haley’s relatively few.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6m%2FtrnPZp%2BapJWuerG7y6WqZqufqsGpecKaqaikmaOubr%2FUqZyrZaSqsrSwwLI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
