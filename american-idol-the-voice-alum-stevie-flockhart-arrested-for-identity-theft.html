Flockhart is the lead pastor of the 901 Church in Tennessee.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-the-voice-alum-stevie-flockhart-arrested>American Idol, The Voice Alum Stevie Flockhart Arrested</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">local news</a>, Flockhart has been charged with identity theft and theft of property after one of his parishioners accused him of using his information to open a credit card. Flockhart was reportedly arrested on November 2. He was released the next day after posting $2,000 bond.</p><p>The Shelby County Sheriff’s Office had reportedly spoken to the parishioner in question back in September about an identity theft three years prior. He said Flockhart was planning to open a joint credit card for the church. He gave Flockhart his personal information over the phone.</p><p>When the parishioner’s credit score dropped “significantly,” he discovered that a credit card had been opened with his information. It had more than $6,400 in unpaid charges on it. The parishioner contacted the lienholder, who confirmed that the application’s phone number belonged to Flockhart.</p><p>Following Flockhart’s arrest, 901 Church posted about the situation on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>, writing, “While we do not find the allegations factual, we believe that vindication is from God and stand firm in His sovereignty and truth.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PAULA ADBUL SAYS SHE’S ‘PROUD’ OF ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ WINNER CARRIE UNDERWOOD</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-flockhart-appeared-on-two-seasons-of-idol>Flockhart Appeared on Two Seasons of Idol</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heavy</a>, Flockhart made it to Hollywood Week in both Season 9 and Season 10 of American Idol. In 2012, he spoke about his “obsession” with becoming a music star. He said he believed “God was calling” on him to start a church, but he put it off to pursue music.</p><p>Several outlets have also reported that Flockhart was a contestant on The Voice. According to Heavy, Flockhart’s church bio says he was “selected as a contestant” on the show. It’s not clear which season he appeared on.</p><p>According to a local news report, multiple people say their church memberships were revoked when they complained about Flockhart’s behavior to church elders. Flockhart was reportedly sued in 2020 over accusations of forging documents and impersonating a credit card account holder at another church in Georgia.</p><p>A petition <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has been started</a> to “demand a criminal fraud investigation” into Flockhart. The petition, which currently has 115 signatures, accuses Flockhart of “living a lavish lifestyle off the backs of his parishioners.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_ClaudiaB_NoahSpencer_Huntley-220x147.jpg alt="Artists Fight to Keep Their Spot on Team Niall in ‘The Voice’ Early Release Knockout" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2asmJp6t7vInJxmmZyqum6%2F056top1dm7mwr8qhmKusXZa%2Fs7HSrZydZZakv261w56lraGkrnq1tMSfq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
