But after 28&nbsp;years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, this love story makes&nbsp;us believe in&nbsp;true love, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;didn’t start out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fairytale or&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic movie script.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were amazed by&nbsp;all the things this couple has to&nbsp;teach&nbsp;us, and we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;share them with you.</p><p><h2>Kelly was tangled in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship when she met John.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1cb/281/3956d85365855cc82ec853fc5a.jpg><p>When John and Kelly <a href=#>met</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;screen test back in&nbsp;1989 for the movie <a href=#>The Experts</a>, she was married, not happily married according to&nbsp;<a href=#>her,</a> but still in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship. That complicated things, because they were in&nbsp;the public eye, but it&nbsp;wasn’t enough to&nbsp;make John forget about her.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;took 2&nbsp;years for them to&nbsp;get married.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2eb/9f4/f3924b56d5a4e69d5c38f08587.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1991, John got on&nbsp;one knee and proposed to&nbsp;Kelly. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big surprise for everyone since they had not been together for that long, but she accepted and they were engaged and really happy. Kelly <a href=#>said</a> the feeling was so&nbsp;strong, she believed it&nbsp;was love at&nbsp;first sight.</p><p>Kelly was pregnant with their son Jett when they exchanged vows and in&nbsp;2000 they had a&nbsp;daughter together, named Ella Bleu. They were always the most supporting and loving parents to&nbsp;both of&nbsp;their kids. They were experiencing a&nbsp;good moment in&nbsp;their lives.</p><p><h2>They had to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;give one another space.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2009 John and Kelly <a href=#>lost</a> their firstborn son, Jett, due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;seizure during a&nbsp;vacation trip to&nbsp;the Bahamas. This caused a&nbsp;big hole in&nbsp;their lives and the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> started to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through a&nbsp;really hard time.</p><p>It&nbsp;was by&nbsp;giving each other the space to&nbsp;grieve and being there for each other that things started to&nbsp;turn around. In&nbsp;2010, Kelly gave birth to&nbsp;their third child, a&nbsp;little boy named Benjamin, that, <a href=#>according</a> to&nbsp;John, brought light and joy back into their house. It&nbsp;was at&nbsp;this point that they were ready to&nbsp;start changing the mood of&nbsp;their home and lives again.</p><p><h2>After 28&nbsp;years, they are still thankful to&nbsp;have each other.</h2></p><p>Recently they celebrated 28&nbsp;years together. The couple that has been through thick and thin, didn’t hold anything back when complimenting each other and showing their love and affection in&nbsp;their <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> <a href=#>posts</a>.</p><p>The actress <a href=#>said</a> that her wonderful husband makes her feel that, as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;they are together, everything is&nbsp;okay. While John <a href=#>thanked</a> Kelly for all the love she gives him and their kids. Showing that they have overcome the lows and enjoyed the highs, and it&nbsp;has only made their love stronger.</p><p>Are you someone, or&nbsp;do&nbsp;you know someone, that has been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship for a&nbsp;long time?
