He then moved into “Make It Rain,” which he famously covered for the Sons of Anarchy soundtrack in 2014. The bluesy song really shows off his vocal talent.</p><p>The singer also debuted the bouncy new song “Overpass Graffiti,” which is also featured on the upcoming album. “I will always love you, for what it’s worth / We’ll never fade like graffiti on the overpass,” Sheeran sings in the track’s chorus.</p><p>After that, Sheeran moved on to “Visiting Hours,” which is dedicated to his friend Michael Gudinski, who passed away in March.

Neither the singer nor SNL <a href=#>has made an announcement</a> about it yet, so we’ll just have to wait and see.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1348364735-1.jpg alt="Melanie C Dishes About On-Stage Cameo with Coldplay at Hollywood Bowl" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ed sheeran</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecyenpplnZq7tbvRZpydZaOdsqa%2BwKdkqZ2im7yzudJmq6KmqWKxpr%2FKZpqoppOav7V5xaumpmWYpLqmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
