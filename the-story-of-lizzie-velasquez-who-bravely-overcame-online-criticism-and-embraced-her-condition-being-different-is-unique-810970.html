Despite the online hate, Lizzie was able to&nbsp;take the opportunity to&nbsp;raise awareness and inspired many to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kinder to&nbsp;others as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;themselves.</p><p><h2>She was diagnosed with a&nbsp;rare health condition as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b18/7c5/70834d5380ac5dd0ed3280e8e6.jpg><p>Born in&nbsp;Austin, Texas, Lizzie Velasquez was diagnosed with a&nbsp;rare condition, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>neonatal progeroid syndrome</a>, which prevented her from gaining weight and affected her eyes, bones, and heart. Lizzie didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realize</a> she was different in&nbsp;any way from anyone else since her parents never treated her any differently. “They loved me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;so&nbsp;many unknowns.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce2/eba/e3a9795254a996106b5eee959c.jpg><p>She only realized she was different when children in&nbsp;kindergarten appeared scared of&nbsp;her, but Lizzie says her parents supported her through her tough times, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “There is&nbsp;nothing wrong with you, you are just smaller than the other kids. You are beautiful and smart and can accomplish anything.” Eventually, by&nbsp;the time Lizzie was in&nbsp;high school, she became more confident and outgoing and found herself being more positive.</p><p><h2>She found herself becoming a&nbsp;target for online hate at&nbsp;just 17.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/762/f88/f427a15cbaacec8a5c916c1a0a.jpg><p>However, in&nbsp;2006, when Lizzie was&nbsp;17, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> a&nbsp;YouTube video referring to&nbsp;herself as&nbsp;“The World’s Ugliest Woman” with over 4&nbsp;million views and many negative comments. Lizzie, who had become more confident at&nbsp;the time, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>felt</a> that “within 2&nbsp;seconds, everything that&nbsp;I had worked for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;that point was just sort of&nbsp;knocked over and done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebc/e2e/40b8315fe79e050bd8656c06a7.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first, Lizzie was distressed by&nbsp;the onslaught of&nbsp;<a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a> she received. But as&nbsp;she later realized, the video changed her life forever. “I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;retaliate&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;time. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;prove them wrong.” Once she had her mind set on&nbsp;this goal, Lizzie used this moment to&nbsp;redefine her life completely.</p><p><h2>She didn’t let the criticism get to&nbsp;her and instead used her platform for good.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d0/b1a/0028d256ac8108b7c5e7efb024.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2013, Lizzie gave a&nbsp;TEDx talk in&nbsp;Austin about her experience with online hate in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;raise awareness. The talk was extremely successful, and in&nbsp;2015, Lizzie received the opportunity to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;documentary made about her experience called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story</i></a><i>. </i>Soon, she spread her positive message to&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge online following on&nbsp;her <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> platforms as&nbsp;well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04c/b14/663ee85dad80ee6ba9a7f800bb.jpg><p>Lizzie tries to&nbsp;remain open as&nbsp;possible, saying she stays positive by&nbsp;letting herself be&nbsp;vulnerable and honest with herself and others. “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;remind people that at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, yes, I&nbsp;am an&nbsp;inspiration and <a href=# title=motivation data-link=tag>motivation</a> for people, but I&nbsp;am human. It’s okay to&nbsp;show your vulnerable side, and people won’t see you as&nbsp;weak,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>She hopes her story can inspire others to&nbsp;overcome hate as&nbsp;well.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b5/53c/5d6062517d96d3ddb86827d418.jpg><p>Lizzie Velasquez took a&nbsp;negative thing in&nbsp;her life and turned it&nbsp;into something to&nbsp;inspire others. “Awful things happened to&nbsp;me, but I&nbsp;am still here, smiling and happy.” The motivational speaker continues to&nbsp;use her platform to&nbsp;fight against online negativity and encourage people to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kinder, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;hope with my&nbsp;story I’m able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;that reminder to&nbsp;other people that no&nbsp;matter your circumstance, you can achieve whatever you put your mind&nbsp;to.”</p><p>What part of&nbsp;Lizzie Velasquez’s story inspired you the most?
