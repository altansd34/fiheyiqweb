The judges were all very impressed even Simon Cowell who said “Well this shouldn’t actually happen, you’re tiny. Your voice is huge. I have a feeling you may be looking at a star in the future.”</p><p>Following her successful audition, the young singer went on to the live shows where she continued to dominate the competition. At one point in the show, guest judge Chris Hardwick was so impressed when she sang Alicia Keys’ “Girl on Fire” that he pressed his Golden Buzzer for her.</p><p>Unfortunately, Angelica ended up being the runner-up that season after losing to winner Darci Lynne Farmer. This shocked fans who thought that Hale would go on to win the show. Her journey did not end there and it would not be the last time she was heard of. She went on to do many things with her singing career and came back for a second chance at winning the title during&nbsp; ‘AGT: The Champions.’</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: </strong><a href=# class=broken_link><strong>9-YEAR-OLD TAKES ON POWERFUL ‘LION KING’ SONG AND SHOCKS EVERYONE IN THE ROOM</strong></a></p><h3>Angelica Returned to the Stage For Big Comeback</h3><p>Angelica auditioned for ‘AGT: The Champions’ at 11-years-old, two years older than when she first took the stage of ‘AGT’.She moved everyone with her voice and sang the heartfelt song “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten and she impressed Howie Mandel so much that he pressed his Golden Buzzer for her again! making her the first act to ever receive two Golden Buzzers in two different seasons of the show.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAxcO9lfeDA</p><p>Hale told the judges right before her audition, “Tonight I really am just fighting for my place here at AGT: Champions, and I think the song really applies to what I’m doing here.” Simon reacted by telling her that that’s what makes her a champion.
