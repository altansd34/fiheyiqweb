You’re not the only one; we’ve recommended watching <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish-language movies</a> before. That’s because watching films and shows is one of the most efficient ways <a href=#>to learn a new language</a>. Since there’s a story to follow, they keep you engaged for longer than a textbook would.</p><p>Movies don’t just help you learn new vocabulary and everyday idioms. They also help you sharpen your grammar, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pronunciation</a> and listening skills. And films give us a peek into all those <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cultural nuances</a> we would otherwise miss… all with a side of popcorn, of course.</p><p>So, let’s explore the best <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish-speaking</a> movies Hulu has to offer. ¿Listos y listas? (Ready, everyone?)</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Spanish-dubbed-movies-on-Hulu>Spanish-dubbed movies on Hulu</h2><p>You can find countless films on Hulu with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanis</a>h subtitles. But we’re here to challenge ourselves, right? If you’re not sure you’re ready to watch original Spanish-language content, you can try the next best thing: Spanish-dubbed películas (movies).&nbsp;</p><p>Dubbing is the process of re-recording a film in a different language. When it’s done well, the dubbed speech syncs up pretty seamlessly with the actors’ lips. One advantage of dubbing for language learners is that the process often utilizes voice actors with a neutral accent and standard vocabulary.&nbsp;</p><p>Before we dive into our watchlist, here’s a tip: look for dubbed movies you are already familiar with! Since you know the plot, you’ll be able to focus more on vocabulary.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Shrek</h3><p><strong>Director and year:</strong> Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, 2001</p><p><strong>Genre</strong>: Animated fantasy comedy</p><p>A classic feel-good movie, Shrek turns all fairytale tropes on their head, and we’re here for it.&nbsp;</p><p>This animated film follows the story of a grumpy green ogre who finds his solitude interrupted by a horde of fairytale characters. Shrek sets out to deal with the mean Lord Farquaad, who expelled the annoying creatures into Shrek’s land. He offers Farquaad a trade in which he’ll get his home back if he rescues Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded tower… but Fiona is hiding a dark secret.</p><p>Chances are, you’ve watched Shrek a few times already. You likely know the plot and even some of the more memorable quotes. This familiarity is key, as it will allow you to center your attention on new vocabulary and grammatical structures.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Zombieland</h3><p><strong>Director and year:</strong> Ruben Fleischer, 2009</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Comedy, Horror</p><p>Up for a post-apocalyptic comedy with a dash of horror? Yup, Zombieland has all that.&nbsp;</p><p>This cult film follows four survivors who join forces in the midst of a zombie-ridden USA. Each one of them has a particular quest in mind: a shy student travels to Ohio to check on his parents; a Florida-bound zombie killer is determined to secure the very last Twinkie in the country; and two sisters strive to reach a supposedly zombie-free amusement park in Los Angeles. Will they survive?</p><p>Thanks to its casual back-and-forth dialogue, Zombieland is great if you’re looking to learn everyday vocabulary. Additionally, the dialogue is relatively simple, since there aren’t that many characters in the movie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Best-movies-in-Spanish-on-Hulu>Best movies in Spanish on Hulu</h2><p>Ready for the next level? These are all originally filmed in Spanish, so they’re ideal if you’re looking to learn colloquialisms and immerse yourself in the natural rhythms of the language.</p><p>Always take note of a movie’s country of origin. Generally, this is an indication of the particular accent and vocabulary present in the movie.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Penumbra</h3><p><strong>Director and year:</strong> Adrián and Ramiro García Bogliano, 2012</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror</p><p><strong>Country:</strong> Argentina</p><p>This horror-thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last frame.&nbsp;</p><p>Set in the atmospheric capital city of Buenos Aires, Penumbra tells the story of Marga, a successful and arrogant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish</a> businesswoman trying to find new tenants for her family’s spooky city apartment. When she finds a suitable (albeit shady) prospect, she is thrown into a wild wind of horror while a solar eclipse ominously looms over the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Penumbra is an excellent opportunity to compare and contrast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Argentinian</a> and Spanish accents. You may pick up on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four major grammatical differences</a> between Latin American Spanish and the Spanish spoken in Spain’.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Medianeras</h3><p><strong>Director and year:</strong> Gustavo Taretto, 2011</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Comedy-drama</p><p><strong>Country:</strong> Argentina</p><p>What would the world be without a heartfelt drama?&nbsp;</p><p>Medianeras is a thought-provoking story about loneliness and heartbreak in the digital age.
