In one of the shots, they’re in an elegant ballroom pose while the giraffe eats from Hough’s hand.</p><p>The dancer also took photos of lions and gorillas. He explained that they saw a family of gorillas in an extinct volcano in Rwanda. He even imitated the sound they made to tell the gorillas that they were friends. They had to shoo the baby gorillas away to avoid touching them.</p><p>Hough also told the hosts that he’s been <a href=#>framing his new house</a>. He said he enjoys building things, comparing it to choreographing a dance routine. When asked if he ever has a shirt on when he works on the house, he replied, “No, absolutely not. Why would you?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>DEREK HOUGH WINS THIRD EMMY FOR ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ CHOREOGRAPHY</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hough-talks-about-his-las-vegas-residency>Hough Talks About His Las Vegas Residency</h3><p>Hough has a show called <a href=#>No Limit</a> at the Venetian in Las Vegas.
