That’s likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the case when their kid’s birthday is&nbsp;just around the corner. Everyone starts getting excited but, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, we&nbsp;might not always have enough time or&nbsp;energy to&nbsp;carry out all the surprises we&nbsp;had planned for that special occasion. Still, everyone’s hoping it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;an&nbsp;unforgettable day. But what happens when we&nbsp;actually fail to&nbsp;meet everyone’s expectations? At&nbsp;first, we&nbsp;might worry and experience a&nbsp;strange sense of&nbsp;guilt. But it&nbsp;could also happen that this “failure” will help&nbsp;us realize that we&nbsp;were taking the wrong approach in&nbsp;the first place. Our kid’s reactions may even end up&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;us something new.</p><p>And that’s exactly what <strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you today, the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;birthday party that ended with a&nbsp;life-changing lesson for the kid’s parents.</p><p>Nina’s birthday was just around the corner. She was turning&nbsp;6, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big deal when you’re a&nbsp;kid. The previous birthday parties we&nbsp;had thrown had been amazing. Themed parties, perfect cakes with several layers of&nbsp;frosting, lots of&nbsp;colors and eye-catching details. Bouncy castles, entertainers, lights of&nbsp;all shapes and sizes. And lots of&nbsp;music. I&nbsp;remember thinking that that was the kind of&nbsp;party I’d like to&nbsp;have if&nbsp;I were a&nbsp;kid. I&nbsp;saw Nina was happy and enjoying her time with her <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a>. And we&nbsp;were happy and relaxed, just watching her laugh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b4/43a/be8ad15fde82ee326f7c37ba76.jpg><p>But this year had been a&nbsp;tough one. My&nbsp;husband had lost his job not long ago and my&nbsp;income had been reduced significantly. Our combined income barely made it&nbsp;possible for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;maintain the lifestyle we&nbsp;had led until then. This was at&nbsp;the <a href=# title=expense data-link=tag>expense</a> of&nbsp;debt and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;personal sacrifices. Under these conditions, it&nbsp;was clear that we&nbsp;were far from being able to&nbsp;put together Nina’s dream birthday party.</p><p>At&nbsp;first, I&nbsp;was angry that we&nbsp;were going through such a&nbsp;rough patch. We&nbsp;had been working so&nbsp;hard lately and couldn’t even celebrate a&nbsp;birthday... Then I&nbsp;felt sad. It’s almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;our daughter was being punished for something she hadn’t done. I&nbsp;simply went into denial: Nina’s birthday party would be&nbsp;just as&nbsp;great as&nbsp;the previous ones. I&nbsp;thought throwing a&nbsp;slightly smaller party would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea and looked for sales of&nbsp;all kinds.</p><p>Nina’s dad and&nbsp;I spent weeks crunching numbers. I&nbsp;even thought about asking for a&nbsp;loan. Finally, it&nbsp;sunk&nbsp;in: by&nbsp;doing all those things, the only thing we’d get for sure was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stress and debt, more than we&nbsp;already had.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34d/d70/7b71fe5c548b987404ddb6f068.jpg><p>I&nbsp;made up&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind. It&nbsp;didn’t make any sense to&nbsp;keep looking for alternatives, it&nbsp;was just never going to&nbsp;work. While we&nbsp;always made sure to&nbsp;keep Nina protected from experiencing our money issues, this time things were different. It&nbsp;was her birthday and there was no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;hide&nbsp;it, things had to&nbsp;change. One afternoon, when we&nbsp;were coming back from school, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;tell her. This year, her birthday party would not be&nbsp;like other years. We&nbsp;couldn’t afford to&nbsp;rent a&nbsp;party hall or&nbsp;invite many guests, entertainers, and castles.</p><p>Her answer left me&nbsp;speechless. Nina looked at&nbsp;me&nbsp;with surprise, opened her big, shiny blue eyes, and smiled at&nbsp;me, “So, we&nbsp;can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;home?” She looked happy. “Sure,” I&nbsp;said, “at&nbsp;home, with a&nbsp;few friends, your uncles, aunts, grandpa, and&nbsp;us.” Then, I&nbsp;thought about what&nbsp;I had just said. I&nbsp;repeated it&nbsp;in&nbsp;mind. It&nbsp;actually didn’t sound like a&nbsp;bad party at&nbsp;all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec2/ffe/f3b27051249fa920df5d851718.jpg><p>A&nbsp;party at&nbsp;home with close <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> members and her best friends. How had&nbsp;I not considered that before? Far from what I&nbsp;expected, Nina’s face was glowing. All this time, I&nbsp;thought she wouldn’t want to&nbsp;have “just a&nbsp;party at&nbsp;home,” but she actually preferred&nbsp;it. She didn’t even want to&nbsp;invite all her classmates. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, not all of&nbsp;them were really her friends. Most were just kids she had to&nbsp;spend time with because they were in&nbsp;the same class, but nothing else.</p><p>I&nbsp;suddenly started seeing things&nbsp;I hadn’t noticed in&nbsp;previous parties. It&nbsp;wasn’t the idyllic ones, the perfect things&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;see. Everything her face was saying through her expression of&nbsp;relief was true. Nina didn’t enjoy playing in&nbsp;the ball pit nor the loud music. More than once, I&nbsp;had had to&nbsp;comfort her because she was crying. I&nbsp;now remembered how often&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;encourage her to&nbsp;join a&nbsp;game because she was too shy and didn’t really want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what the animators proposed.</p><p>My&nbsp;mood and my&nbsp;husband’s changed. We&nbsp;set out to&nbsp;prepare the birthday party, together, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family: Nina made her own invitations, we&nbsp;decorated the house with balloons, garlands, and drawings made by&nbsp;the three of&nbsp;us. The cake was not perfect, of&nbsp;course, but it&nbsp;was delicious and looked like a&nbsp;real homemade cake.</p><p>We&nbsp;only had a&nbsp;few guests: her three best friends and our closest family members. Nina’s dad was the entertainer, and he&nbsp;was the best of&nbsp;them all. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day, Nina came to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and said: “It&nbsp;was the best birthday of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;hope the next ones are just like this one.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/808/50e/4855ee5b9aa423013632ec525b.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, she’ll probably change her mind in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few years, even if&nbsp;she doesn’t know it&nbsp;yet. One day, there will be&nbsp;no&nbsp;more balloons, no&nbsp;more pink, no&nbsp;more dolls. She’ll prefer to&nbsp;go&nbsp;dancing and meet boys instead. But what matters the most is&nbsp;what we&nbsp;learned that day as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. Children have their own way of&nbsp;expressing their minds, and we&nbsp;must learn to&nbsp;listen. We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell the difference between what we&nbsp;want and what they want.</p><p>We&nbsp;must see beyond what we&nbsp;think is&nbsp;best for them to&nbsp;understand what actually is&nbsp;best for them. They are people, just like&nbsp;us, and they have their own perspective on&nbsp;life, their own type of&nbsp;wisdom. They look at&nbsp;life with different eyes; for them, material things, luxury, and excess are almost never associated with <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a>.</p><p>I&nbsp;think they might want to&nbsp;spend time with family and friends, to&nbsp;connect in&nbsp;a&nbsp;real way. Kids appreciate it&nbsp;when we&nbsp;take the time to&nbsp;enter their world and experience things the way they&nbsp;do. After all, isn’t that what makes&nbsp;us all happy? To&nbsp;have the courage to&nbsp;step into someone else’s shoes and connect with that person?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d4/643/ec95aa545db90566c6a2b28113.jpg><p>What about you?
