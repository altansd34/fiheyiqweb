Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen) and Suki Waterhouse</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb0/59b/e4e4d656b989e041ba672d7083.jpg><p>The actor, who knew how to&nbsp;make&nbsp;us fall in&nbsp;love with his character Edward Cullen, has already found his better half. After <a href=# title=dating data-link=tag>dating</a> <a href=# title="Kristen Stewart" data-link=tag>Kristen Stewart</a>, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the singer FKA Twigs, Pattinson <a href=#>began</a> a&nbsp;relationship with the model Suki Waterhouse. They’ve been dating for 2&nbsp;years now, and even though they prefer to&nbsp;keep their private lives as&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret, every time they show up&nbsp;together they seem very happy.</p><p><h2>2. Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) and Dylan Meyer</h2></p><p>After breaking up&nbsp;with model Stella Maxwell, Kristen fell in&nbsp;love <a href=#>again</a>. And this new romance has nothing to&nbsp;envy when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the love story that Bella and Edward lived in&nbsp;Twilight. The actress, who will play Princess Diana in&nbsp;her next film, is&nbsp;paired up&nbsp;with screenwriter Dylan Meyer, whom she met on&nbsp;a&nbsp;film set several years earlier. They met again on&nbsp;the birthday of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mutual friend and the connection between them was so&nbsp;strong that Stewart says she is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;propose.</p><p><h2>3. Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black) and Taylor Dome</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a83/615/53aca5503c9373ecc9eee563e4.jpg><p>Taylor Lautner is&nbsp;another of&nbsp;Twilight’s actors who, with his interpretation of&nbsp;Jacob Black, stole our heart. But his heart is&nbsp;already <a href=#>owned</a> by&nbsp;Taylor Dome, a&nbsp;young nursing grad. Lautner took it&nbsp;upon himself to&nbsp;congratulate her with a&nbsp;romantic <a href=#>post</a> on&nbsp;his Instagram account. Before Dome, Lautner had dated some celebrities like <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and Taylor Swift.</p><p><h2>4. Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen) and Paul Khoury</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69e/d32/ecf41d5bc793a7102704f1a5d3.jpg><p>The actress who gave life to&nbsp;Alice Cullen <a href=#>has paired herself up</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;TV presenter Paul Khoury. She had previously dated singer <a href=#>Joe Jonas</a>. But, along with Khoury, Ashley seems to&nbsp;have finally found happiness, as&nbsp;they were married in&nbsp;2018. “This is&nbsp;the most beautiful moment&nbsp;I could have ever hoped for. You’ve successfully made me&nbsp;the happiest, luckiest woman alive. I&nbsp;can’t wait to&nbsp;show you my&nbsp;unfaltering immeasurable love for the rest of&nbsp;our lives,” Greene <a href=#>wrote</a> in&nbsp;her Instagram account after Paul orchestrated a&nbsp;magical proposal to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>5. Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen) and Brittany Gonzales</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34e/538/22611e54498604c5bdd829f4b4.jpg><p>Lutz is&nbsp;another actor who has a&nbsp;dreamlike love relationship in&nbsp;real life. When he&nbsp;met model Brittany Gonzales, they knew they were made for each other. That’s why they<a href=#> got married</a> in&nbsp;2017 and recently announced that they are <a href=#>expecting</a> a&nbsp;baby. For the ex-vampire, Gonzales <a href=#>is&nbsp;</a>his best friend and his dream wife.</p><p><h2>6. Nikki Reed (Rosalie Hale) and Ian Somerhalder</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2b/521/4ae67552c38f2f190c01785763.jpg><p>Vampires seem to&nbsp;have taken root in&nbsp;Nikki Reed’s heart. The actress not only played Rosalie’s character in&nbsp;The Twilight Saga, but she also fell in&nbsp;love with actor Ian Somerhalder, star of&nbsp;the <a href=#>series</a> The Vampire Diaries. Their love was born in&nbsp;2014, they then confirmed their commitment in&nbsp;2015, and got married that same year. For the wedding, the couple <a href=#>asked</a> their guests to&nbsp;donate to&nbsp;their animal rescue organization instead of&nbsp;giving them gifts. They eventually announced that they were expecting their first daughter, <a href=#>Bodhi Soleil</a>.</p><p><h2>7. Jackson Rathbone (Jasper Hale) and Sheila Hafsadi</h2></p><p>Jackson has a&nbsp;beautiful <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. He&nbsp;<a href=#>married</a> Sheila Hafsadi in&nbsp;2013, after already having a&nbsp;son together. And later&nbsp;on, the rest of&nbsp;the children began to&nbsp;arrive. The first one was born in&nbsp;2012, they named him Monroe Jackson and chose Nikki Reed as&nbsp;his godmother. The second one arrived in&nbsp;2016 and was named Presley Bowie. Finally, Sheila gave birth to&nbsp;<a href=#>Felix</a> in&nbsp;2019.</p><p><h2>8. Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen) and Lily Harrison</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/46a/204/63488a5a3990fa4e7d76966ee8.jpg><p>“A&nbsp;magical night with this incredible woman.

The actor, who <a href=#>has</a> 3&nbsp;daughters with his ex-wife (actress Jennie Garth), now seems to&nbsp;have found the owner of&nbsp;his heart.</p><p><h2>9. Sarah Clarke (Renée Dwyer) and Xander Berkeley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b64/b99/4d0f7158a8bf000ed71c03f790.jpg><p>Sarah Clarke not only played an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;The Twilight Saga, she is&nbsp;also the protagonist of&nbsp;a&nbsp;real life love story. She <a href=#>met</a> actor Xander Berkeley while filming the series&nbsp;24, fell in&nbsp;love with him, and married him in&nbsp;2002. They are the parents of&nbsp;2&nbsp;girls: Olwyn Harper and Rowan.</p><p><h2>10. Justin Chon (Eric Yorkie) and Sasha Egorova</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a05/843/3b1440534d9fd5554277c29cdb.jpg><p>This actor, who gave life to&nbsp;Bella’s friend Eric Yorkie, married Sasha Egorova in&nbsp;<a href=#>2014</a> and they haven’t been apart from each other ever since. On&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2017, they <a href=#>welcomed</a> their first daughter.</p><p><h2>11. Christian Serratos (Angela Weber) and David Boyd</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57e/5f3/1635355093a0bdbfd089f2ba99.jpg><p><a href=#>Christian</a>, who has Mexican heritage, is&nbsp;paired with David Boyd, lead singer of&nbsp;the alternative rock band New Politics. In&nbsp;2017 they had a&nbsp;daughter named <a href=#>Wolfgang</a>, who they don’t show much of&nbsp;on&nbsp;their social networks. But what we&nbsp;do&nbsp;know is&nbsp;that Serratos affectionately <a href=#>calls</a> her “little&nbsp;W.”</p><p><h2>12. Michael Welch (Mike Newton) and Samantha Maggio</h2></p><p>Welch, who played another of&nbsp;Bella’s friends, married model Samantha Maggio in&nbsp;2016, after <a href=#>proposing</a> to&nbsp;her from a&nbsp;stage during a&nbsp;charity event in&nbsp;Beverly Hills.
