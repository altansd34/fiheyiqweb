They tend to&nbsp;blame themselves for not finding their “other half” and let shame overwhelm them. They are used to&nbsp;hearing questions about why they are still single and why they are being selfish and not settling down. Ignoring these questions would be&nbsp;amazing, but it&nbsp;would also be&nbsp;better to&nbsp;fire back and let people know that they can’t tell you what to&nbsp;do.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>wants to&nbsp;give you a&nbsp;few pointers on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;talk back to&nbsp;someone who is&nbsp;clearly intending to&nbsp;shame you about your single status.</p><p><h2>1. Divert the question to&nbsp;show how great your career is&nbsp;going.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc4/371/f44b0e56deac7ded3809b2f9f3.jpg><p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;family member is&nbsp;pressuring you about your dating status, you don’t need to&nbsp;get defensive. Stay on&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>positive</a> side of&nbsp;things and simply <strong>change the topic to&nbsp;something that makes you very happy</strong> at&nbsp;the moment. Your job might be&nbsp;going great and your circle of&nbsp;friends might be&nbsp;fulfilling. So, talk about those things that give you joy and avoid answering the negative comments with even more negativity.</p><p><h2>2. Describe your way of&nbsp;thinking, but don’t defend your choices.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/861/35f/d22a0b5535aa1c1be8c60f776a.jpg><p>Making <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>excuses</a> about your choices might mean that, deep down, you are not as&nbsp;happy as&nbsp;you say you are. But, sometimes people who single shame you, fill you with insecurities and push you to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;defensive stand. Instead of&nbsp;doing that, you can <strong>keep your calm and explain your point of&nbsp;view</strong>. Now, you don’t need to&nbsp;explain your choices in&nbsp;detail to&nbsp;anyone, but just give them a&nbsp;summary of&nbsp;your beliefs.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> has said in&nbsp;the past that, “<strong>We&nbsp;are complete with or&nbsp;without a&nbsp;mate</strong>, with or&nbsp;without a&nbsp;child. We&nbsp;don’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married or&nbsp;mothers to&nbsp;be&nbsp;complete. We&nbsp;get to&nbsp;determine our own ‘happily ever after’ for ourselves. Let’s make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in&nbsp;this world who look to&nbsp;us as&nbsp;examples.”</p><p><h2>3. Ask them straight out if&nbsp;they are jealous.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2e/54e/a8d6b85edeb242d86202a84b2f.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;misconception that only single people can be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>jealous</a> of&nbsp;happily united couples. However, not all couples are happy in&nbsp;their union and they could be&nbsp;jealous of&nbsp;your single status. So, maybe they are putting some effort into <strong>making you feel bad out of&nbsp;pure envy</strong> for the things that you can enjoy while you’re single. If&nbsp;you suspect something like this, you can simply put them on&nbsp;the spot by&nbsp;being straightforward about their jealousy.</p><p><h2>4. You can ask them an&nbsp;awkward question.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bde/9d5/cbec6c52e7b6ceb5b5d512ea0a.jpg><p>This might not be&nbsp;the best thing to&nbsp;do, since you are doing to&nbsp;someone exactly what they are doing to&nbsp;you, but it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;amazing for them to&nbsp;see how inappropriate, intrusive questions make you feel. So, if&nbsp;you are aware of&nbsp;their not-so-awesome relationship or&nbsp;if&nbsp;they have a&nbsp;past divorce, you can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>ask</a> them why they are still married or&nbsp;what happened with their previous relationship. Maybe you can <strong>ask if&nbsp;they are afraid of&nbsp;being alone</strong> and that’s why they stick to&nbsp;a&nbsp;very questionable partner.</p><p><h2>5. Just be&nbsp;sarcastic and crack a&nbsp;joke.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/915/d6f/f1fc5b599bb694552e622e594c.jpg><p>Instead of&nbsp;losing your cool and being mean, you can give a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sarcastic</a> answer that will probably catch a&nbsp;shamer unprepared. All they wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;put you in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tough spot, but you found a&nbsp;great way to&nbsp;clap back. You can tell them how you just don’t have enough money for a&nbsp;wedding or&nbsp;how you are so&nbsp;fabulous that no&nbsp;one can match that fabulosity. <strong>Don’t be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;be&nbsp;snarky</strong> with someone who is&nbsp;too nosey and clearly has bad intentions.</p><p>For example, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Halle Berry</a> hasn’t shied away from expressing her true feelings about being single. “<strong>A&nbsp;man for me&nbsp;is&nbsp;the cherry on&nbsp;the pie.</strong> But I’m the pie and my&nbsp;pie is&nbsp;good all by&nbsp;itself. Even if&nbsp;I don’t have a&nbsp;cherry.”</p><p><h2>6. Say that a&nbsp;partner won’t make your life any more worthy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ee/5e5/7808f75990b0ed59299131f866.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your life isn’t happy and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>fulfilled</a> while you’re on&nbsp;your own, don’t expect a&nbsp;marriage to&nbsp;bring that. People should be&nbsp;full beings and not halves who are looking to&nbsp;fill in&nbsp;the gaps. If&nbsp;you realize that, then you can explain it&nbsp;to&nbsp;someone who single shames you. It&nbsp;doesn’t mean that you don’t want a&nbsp;partner if&nbsp;the right person arrives, but <strong>you don’t expect them to&nbsp;give your life meaning</strong>.</p><p><h2>7. Explain how your previous relationship hurt you and how you need to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;your mental health.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4f/d4d/e1b23a5b54ad41adf69f76acb6.jpg><p>People who single shame you aren’t exactly mindful of&nbsp;your <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>mental</a> and emotional health. They might not know how your previous relationship harmed you and left you with scars you need to&nbsp;heal. You have no&nbsp;responsibility to&nbsp;explain what happened and how it&nbsp;hurt you, but you can simply say that you need to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;yourself. Many <strong>people don’t feel comfortable talking about <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a></strong> and they will probably drop the subject once you make this reference.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Selena Gomez</a> knows the struggle and as&nbsp;she’s said, “<strong>I&nbsp;had low self-esteem</strong>, and that’s something&nbsp;I work on&nbsp;continuously. But I&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;empowered because I’ve gained so&nbsp;much knowledge about what was going on&nbsp;mentally. My&nbsp;highs were really high, and my&nbsp;lows would take me&nbsp;out for weeks at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time. I’ve been single for over 2&nbsp;years now and I’m OK&nbsp;with that.”</p><p>Have you ever experienced single-shaming and, if&nbsp;so, how did you react? Did you become defensive or&nbsp;did you just ignore the comments?</p><p>Bright Side has its own <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>podcasts</a> now.
