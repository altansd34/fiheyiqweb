Regarding numbers, the sums the Portuguese star amassed while wearing Madrid's colours are genuinely astonishing.</p><p class=align-left>44 hat-tricks, 450 goals in 438 <a href=#>games</a>, and six seasons in a row where he scored at least 50 goals. It's safe to say that his performance on the field for Real Madrid as the team's number seven will guarantee his place among the all-time greats.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/53eb3bfb89b5ae6e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which footballer has the most trophies in football history?</span></p></a><h2>Raul</h2><p class=align-left>Raul, a Madrid native, was originally a member of Atlético's youth squad before being snatched up by Los Blancos at the age of 15 in 1992. He eventually made it into the first squad two years later. He began and scored in the Madrid derby in just his second game for the team, and Los Blancos won 4-2.</p><p class=align-left>In 1998, he helped the team achieve the Champions League, their first major European championship in 32 years, and in his first season, they won the first of their six <a href=# rel=noopener>La Liga</a> championships.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>The Spain international fought against every opponent with equal vigour during his tenure in the capital, and in 13 of his 16 seasons with Real, he made at least 40 appearances in all competitions.</p><p class=align-left>He happily wore the number seven for 14 years before adding the captain's armband in 2003. Raul made a record 741 appearances for Los Blancos during his tenure there, and despite playing alongside Galactico's, who had cost the team countless millions, he never appeared out of place while wearing the fabled number 7.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5fb9123d387ccd55.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best centre backs of all time in football history ranked</span></p></a><h2>Juanito</h2><p class=align-left>Juanito was admired as a player more for his zeal and temper than for his football skills. But he had plenty of all three.</p><p class=align-left>He joined Atlético Madrid as a youth player but never played for the senior team, which presumably didn't hurt his reputation among Real supporters in the Spanish capital. He moved to the Bernabéu after four outstanding years with Burgos as they earned promotion.</p><p class=align-left>When he arrived, Juanito cemented his reputation among Madrid supporters by remarking that "playing for Real Madrid is like touching the sky." "If I weren't a player, I'd be an ultra sur," he said before continuing. Juanito played over 400 games during his more than ten years with the team, winning five La Liga championships, two Copas del Rey, and two UEFA Cups.</p><p class=align-left>Juanito tragically died in an automobile accident in 1992 at 37. Even so, he continues to be honoured every time the Bernabéu clock strikes seven minutes, a <a href=#>tribute</a> to the attire number he frequently wore.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/57fbc8f388afc3f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Evans' penalty miss cost Manchester United first trophy of the season</span></p></a><h2>Raymond Kopa</h2><p class=align-left>One player on the Reims team that Madrid had defeated in the 1956 inaugural European Cup final grabbed Santiago Bernabéu's attention: Raymond Kopa.</p><p class=align-left>The Frenchman started the following season sharing a locker room with his defeated opponents, despite having lined up as a centre-forward against Madrid for the championship game. During his three seasons in the city, Kopa, an exquisite forward, fit in with Madrid's front line and helped them win two La Liga championships and three more European Cups.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>He helped Madrid win both the domestic and European championships that year and later assisted France in finishing third at the World Cup. He took home the Ballon d'Or that year after placing third in the previous two competitions.</p><p class=align-left>Even though Kopa was only at Madrid for three seasons, he played on a legendary team and was never one to let the other glitterati on the field eclipse him. "Raymond Kopa did magic, amazing things you didn't think possible," his teammate Juan Santisteban said.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/13a6a271b9c11e64.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chelsea Ready for Changes: 4 Players Expected to Leave as Lukaku Heads to Napoli</span></p></a><h2>Emilio Butragueno</h2><p class=align-left>Emilio Butragueo, a native Madrid socio who joined the team while serving his military duty, was a young, angelic boy with a fresh face and blond hair. Butragueo's deadly finishing in front of goal won him the moniker El Buitre, or the Vulture, in contrast to his soft-spoken and polite demeanour.</p><p class=align-left>Butragueo had ten straight seasons with double digits between 1984 and 1994. He gave his name as El Buitre to La Quinta del Buitre, the Vulture Squad, Madrid's best team since Alfredo Di Stéfano had departed 20 years prior.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>At the age of 20, Madrid was down 2-0 when he entered the game in 1984. Butragueo tallied two goals and assisted in the other by the time the game ended, making the score 3-2. He arrived to represent the Vulture Squad, which was centered on five La Fábrica graduates from Madrid.</p><p class=align-left>This team won two UEFA Cups and five straight La Liga championships with their number 7 Butragueo at the heart of the assault, but the European Cup would always elude El Buitre.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkwLG70a2qaJ6fpMGjrculZmpuYGyDdYWMbmSgqpWWwaa%2F02anpZmpmr%2B0edaemKtlopqurXnMmpuroZSoeq%2FBzJucq2VnYsCptdGtZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
