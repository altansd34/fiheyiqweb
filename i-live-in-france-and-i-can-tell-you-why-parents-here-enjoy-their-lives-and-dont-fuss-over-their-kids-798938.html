And mothers also want to&nbsp;have some free time for themselves and some time to&nbsp;spend with their husbands. It&nbsp;turns out that this is&nbsp;all possible. A&nbsp;woman from Russia went to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;<a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a>, got married there, had 2&nbsp;children, and discovered a&nbsp;unique child-raising system there.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were fascinated by&nbsp;the incredibly useful information from Anna’s blog, where she shares the rules and methods of&nbsp;child-raising in&nbsp;France that help her deal with her many difficult parenting tasks.</p><p><h2>They have a&nbsp;different parenting approach.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e2/a85/c098f4577a986e0c4d4c7c51fa.jpg><p>During the first months of&nbsp;living with my&nbsp;husband, his daughters from his first marriage came to&nbsp;our place, and&nbsp;I played checkers with the older one&nbsp;— she was 7&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time. I&nbsp;was easy on&nbsp;her because&nbsp;I didn’t want to&nbsp;make her sad if&nbsp;I&nbsp;won. And I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;amazed when <strong>her dad played with her as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she were an&nbsp;adult, and of&nbsp;course, he&nbsp;won</strong>.</p><p>When I&nbsp;told him he&nbsp;could have been easier on&nbsp;her, he&nbsp;said, “Why? She has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;lose and deal with these emotions.” Honestly, I&nbsp;had never thought of&nbsp;that. My&nbsp;parents let me&nbsp;win, and now&nbsp;I see a&nbsp;different take on&nbsp;this, and I’m drawing my&nbsp;own conclusions.</p><p><h2>The French are very patient, thanks to&nbsp;their parents.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/857/cea/3ac04754358a18a074639b7219.jpg><ul><li>They don’t run to&nbsp;their babies as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;they wake&nbsp;up. They give babies some time. <strong>They let them lie there and look around</strong>. They have enough time to&nbsp;get used to&nbsp;the room and the cradle. In&nbsp;the future, they will need this skill and they won’t be&nbsp;scared of&nbsp;going to&nbsp;their rooms to&nbsp;sleep.</li><li>When adults talk to&nbsp;each other, and there’s a&nbsp;child calling for mom or&nbsp;dad, <strong>the French don’t stop talking</strong>. They let their kids understand that while 2&nbsp;people are talking, they have to&nbsp;wait until they finish to&nbsp;start talking.</li><li>When a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;calling their mom to&nbsp;ask for something and the mom is&nbsp;busy, she says, “<strong>Let me&nbsp;finish what I’m doing and I’ll come to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;2&nbsp;minutes.</strong>” The child accepts this fact and waits.</li></ul><p><h2>For the local people, patience is&nbsp;a&nbsp;muscle they start training in&nbsp;childhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/203/37b/ec1c695dac990020a27fd6702b.jpg><p>Don’t interrupt your work if&nbsp;your child is&nbsp;asking you to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;a&nbsp;brick tower they built. Just explain to&nbsp;the child what you are busy with and ask them to&nbsp;wait for a&nbsp;little bit. At&nbsp;first, they will wait for just a&nbsp;few seconds. But then, they will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;wait for minutes. <strong>They will learn to&nbsp;entertain themselves while they’re waiting and deal with their frustration</strong>. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;essential skill&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;how a&nbsp;child realizes that they are not the center of&nbsp;the universe.</p><p>It’s not very easy to&nbsp;do. I’m getting better at&nbsp;it&nbsp;now, but it&nbsp;was really hard in&nbsp;the beginning.</p><p><h2>You can’t feel pity for children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8eb/3dc/649ba250f4bdd4e97102799770.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;don’t mean the times when a&nbsp;child really needs support&nbsp;— when they fall, get injured, and so&nbsp;on. But when a&nbsp;child trips over something and starts crying, even if&nbsp;they are not hurt, just because they are a&nbsp;little scared, <strong>you don’t need to&nbsp;hug them and empathize</strong>. If&nbsp;you&nbsp;do, you will only make the situation look even more serious in&nbsp;the kid’s eyes. The consequences:</p><ul><li>Children cry every time they hurt themselves, even if&nbsp;they are not in&nbsp;pain.</li><li>They fall and pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;pain to&nbsp;attract attention.</li><li>In&nbsp;their adult lives, if&nbsp;something doesn’t go&nbsp;as&nbsp;planned, they get really upset and shaken.</li></ul><p>A&nbsp;normal reaction is&nbsp;<strong>to&nbsp;not pay much attention to&nbsp;it</strong>. I’m not a&nbsp;tyrant. I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;kids and&nbsp;I want them to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mentally strong and resilient.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;the past, child-rearing in&nbsp;France was even stricter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/710/859/da44ef51ebb5c23ead04c9cfbd.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;go&nbsp;see my&nbsp;husband’s friend, we&nbsp;often talk about child-rearing. About how things were and how they are today. So, this man had very <strong>strict rules</strong> in&nbsp;his family when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kid.</p><ul><li>He&nbsp;addressed his parents in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very polite way&nbsp;— Vous, Papa.</li><li>During lunch, when the kids were sitting at&nbsp;the table with their parents, they were not allowed to&nbsp;speak. Very often, when a&nbsp;child can already eat on&nbsp;their own, they even sit at&nbsp;a&nbsp;different table.</li><li>Only after finishing their meal are the children allowed to&nbsp;ask for permission to&nbsp;go.</li><li>Children can only play with their toys in&nbsp;their rooms. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;way that toys would just lie around the house.</li></ul><p>Nowadays, it’s really surprising to&nbsp;hear these stories. The times and rules are changing, and children are now allowed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;more.</p><p><h2>There’s no&nbsp;need for mothers to&nbsp;feel guilty.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/52b/84c/d14b3650a18ab80362701a9f0c.jpg><p>Many mothers feel worried all the time. If&nbsp;their child woke&nbsp;up, it’s because they are hungry, scared, ill, or&nbsp;bored... But French women just live and enjoy their lives. They don’t forget about themselves, about their husbands, or&nbsp;about the things they love. <strong>They know that there are no&nbsp;perfect mothers</strong>. They are self-organized and they know how to&nbsp;set the right priorities.</p><p><h2>How French mothers make their everyday lives easier</h2></p><ul><li>Children and adults eat at&nbsp;the same time. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;2 (approximately), kids start eating the same food as&nbsp;adults.</li><li>Children don’t get to&nbsp;choose what they want to&nbsp;eat: mothers cook and they dictate what the kids will eat.</li><li>You will never see a&nbsp;French mother begging a&nbsp;child to&nbsp;eat.</li><li>French kids always take naps at&nbsp;the same time.</li><li>Parents don’t use “baby talk.”</li><li>They don’t use rude words.</li><li>Children play in&nbsp;their rooms while their parents do&nbsp;what they want.</li><li>Children also need <a href=# title="personal space" data-link=tag>personal space</a>. Of&nbsp;course, they do&nbsp;things together and play together.</li><li>Children are taught to&nbsp;be&nbsp;self-sufficient. For example, they help their parents with chores, set the table, etc. Children feel more confident when they do&nbsp;“adult” stuff.</li><li>Children always go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed at&nbsp;the same time, so&nbsp;parents can spend some time together in&nbsp;the evening.</li></ul><p><h2>You won’t see little kids in&nbsp;restaurants very often.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a1/8ed/7238df510fa6934f159457bc7f.jpg><p>Children don’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;restaurants until they are around 4&nbsp;years old. The thing&nbsp;is, for a&nbsp;French person, having a&nbsp;meal is&nbsp;not about eating to&nbsp;live. When an&nbsp;average French person goes to&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant, they do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;rest and have a&nbsp;nice time. This is&nbsp;why French people with small children choose:</p><ul><li>to&nbsp;eat at&nbsp;home.</li><li>McDonald’s.</li><li>a&nbsp;small family cafe.</li></ul><p><h2>In&nbsp;France, they don’t trust their kids with just anyone.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;children and parents go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;walk, they do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;enjoy their time together. I&nbsp;was amazed that in&nbsp;local cafes, there are no&nbsp;“children areas” where parents can send their children to&nbsp;play with others while they rest. When I&nbsp;asked my&nbsp;husband about these areas, <strong>he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;would never trust his child with a&nbsp;person he&nbsp;didn’t know</strong>.</p><p><h2>How children behave at&nbsp;someone else’s place</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7f/dc4/92dd1f5dfa90bd20fd0afc8b15.jpg><ul><li>The most important rule: <strong>children have to&nbsp;ask for permission to&nbsp;start eating</strong>, and they should never take food from the table without asking.</li><li>Very often, children take cookies from a&nbsp;bowl and then change their minds and put them back. This doesn’t look very good. So, if&nbsp;you touch something, you eat it&nbsp;or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;your plate instead of&nbsp;putting it&nbsp;back.</li><li><strong>Children ask for permission to&nbsp;leave the table</strong> and play. You then wipe their hands, and you know they won’t stain anything, and this is&nbsp;what well-mannered kids&nbsp;do.</li><li>Parents always make sure their kids <strong>don’t make too much noise</strong>. Of&nbsp;course, sometimes it’s impossible, especially if&nbsp;they are small and there are more than 2&nbsp;kids. But your job is&nbsp;to&nbsp;let the child know that they are not alone and that they are distracting others. This is&nbsp;how they learn to&nbsp;respect other people.</li><li>There is&nbsp;only one trick to&nbsp;teaching children how to&nbsp;behave at&nbsp;the table. <strong>Parents need to&nbsp;have good manners</strong>. The most important thing is&nbsp;having dinners together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. All family members at&nbsp;the same time. This is&nbsp;the magic time. The sooner you have this tradition, the better.</li></ul><p><h2>They don’t take parenthood extremely seriously.</h2></p><p>We&nbsp;went for a&nbsp;walk and stopped by&nbsp;a&nbsp;butcher shop. I&nbsp;started talking to&nbsp;the seller about kids. And I&nbsp;said something like, “I&nbsp;understand that what&nbsp;I have now is&nbsp;happiness and&nbsp;I will miss it&nbsp;in&nbsp;15&nbsp;years.” And the man replied, “When you are retired, this is&nbsp;when your life just starts. That’s how it&nbsp;was with my&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;me.”</p><p>For French people, life starts at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;50.</p><p><h2>They have an&nbsp;interesting attitude toward divorce.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56d/1ee/7837cd5a86a9c158c43e6cfa98.jpg><p>In&nbsp;France, women file for divorce more often than men. And what’s even more surprising is&nbsp;that they often leave their <strong>children with their husbands</strong> and start building a&nbsp;new family. I’m not judging&nbsp;— I&nbsp;think that a&nbsp;divorce is&nbsp;often the fault of&nbsp;both partners.</p><p>Here’s an&nbsp;example: a&nbsp;local friend of&nbsp;mine lives with a&nbsp;man and 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;his children from his first marriage. Their mom went to&nbsp;Guadeloupe to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with her new man.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have child-rearing tricks that you can share with other people?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuuMivnGahnmKzs63NnJxmmZ6Zeqp5wpqlZqyVobluxc6uZLCgqWK9or7Ep6usZZiav6Z5xKehqLFdqbWmtdFmo6Kulah6orrDZpuopqRis7a%2F0mamr52iYsGpscirZKShlKh6eIWXcmpxZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
