That’s why we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;tell you a&nbsp;story about this Internet celebrity who has definitely crossed your timeline at&nbsp;least once!</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started with a&nbsp;viral TikTok</h2></p><p><strong>The little hero’s full </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>name</strong></a><strong> is&nbsp;Hasbulla Magomedov.</strong> However, he&nbsp;also widely goes under the nickname Hasbik. He&nbsp;was born on&nbsp;July&nbsp;7, 2002. However, he’s not your usual celebrity; he’s a&nbsp;popular figure on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>. What makes him stand out is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;has dwarfism, a&nbsp;condition caused by&nbsp;not having enough growth hormones. Standing at&nbsp;just 102&nbsp;cm (3.4&nbsp;feet) tall, Hasbulla is&nbsp;quite small compared to&nbsp;most people.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;2021, he&nbsp;shot to&nbsp;stardom because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>TikTok video</strong></a><strong> that spread like wildfire on&nbsp;the Internet. </strong>Since then, he’s teamed up&nbsp;with some big names in&nbsp;mixed martial arts, like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Islam Makhachev</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alexander Volkanovski</a>. But that’s not all; he’s also been hanging out with other famous folks like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dana White</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mark Wahlberg</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Shaquille O’Neal,</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Nelk Boys</a>.</p><p><strong>People love Hasbulla for his unique personality and how he&nbsp;connects with others. Despite his small stature, he’s making big social media and <a href=# title=entertainment data-link=tag>entertainment</a> waves.</strong> It’s fascinating to&nbsp;see how someone so&nbsp;small can have such a&nbsp;huge impact and be&nbsp;friends with some of&nbsp;the biggest names in&nbsp;the business. Hasbulla is&nbsp;proof that size doesn’t always matter when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;making a&nbsp;name for yourself.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;escape his school to&nbsp;start doing what he&nbsp;likes</h2></p><p>Growing&nbsp;up, his dad <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;plumber, humbly making their living. Hasbulla follows the Muslim faith and belongs to&nbsp;the Dargin ethnicity. His roots and background are an&nbsp;essential part of&nbsp;who he&nbsp;is.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his interviews, Hasbulla shared that he&nbsp;didn’t enjoy his time at&nbsp;school, describing it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“prison.” This insight into his past gave a&nbsp;glimpse into his challenges during those four years. According to&nbsp;his informal interpreter, Surkhay Sungurov, <strong>Hasbulla went to&nbsp;great lengths to&nbsp;escape the confines of&nbsp;the school. He&nbsp;convinced a&nbsp;friend to&nbsp;drive a&nbsp;whopping 200 kilometers to&nbsp;help him break free.</strong></p><p><strong>Once he&nbsp;successfully left the school, Hasbulla embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new journey—creating videos for the Internet. </strong>This marked a&nbsp;significant turning point in&nbsp;his life, leading to&nbsp;the fame and recognition he&nbsp;enjoys today. The shift from a&nbsp;restrictive environment to&nbsp;the creative freedom of&nbsp;the Internet allowed Hasbulla to&nbsp;showcase his unique personality and connect with a&nbsp;global audience.</p><p>Through his videos, he&nbsp;transcended the limitations he&nbsp;felt in&nbsp;the school. <strong>His escape wasn’t just physical but also symbolic, representing his liberation from constraints. The Internet became his canvas, and with each video, Hasbulla painted a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;resilience, humor, and authenticity.</strong> His journey as&nbsp;an&nbsp;Internet sensation demonstrates the power of&nbsp;determination and the ability to&nbsp;overcome challenges.</p><p>Hasbulla’s story is&nbsp;not just about fame; it’s about breaking free from circumstances’ limitations and creating a&nbsp;space where he&nbsp;could be&nbsp;himself. In&nbsp;the vast world of&nbsp;the Internet, Hasbulla found his voice and made a&nbsp;name for himself, proving that sometimes, escaping the “prisons” of&nbsp;life can lead to&nbsp;unexpected and extraordinary adventures.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;gained viral success from the very beginning</h2></p><p><strong>Since November 2020, Hasbulla has amassed an&nbsp;impressive </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>following</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;over eight and a&nbsp;half million fans on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>.</strong> His journey to&nbsp;fame kicked off when he&nbsp;went viral on&nbsp;<a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a>, cleverly using humor to&nbsp;mock mixed martial arts (MMA) content playfully.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his early <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>viral videos</a>, Hasbulla showcased his wit by&nbsp;driving a&nbsp;motorized scooter while amusingly lecturing a&nbsp;young cyclist about pandemic restrictions, urging him to&nbsp;head home. Another endearing moment captured him enjoying strawberries in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lighthearted video.</p><p><strong>His fame reached new heights when he&nbsp;earned the nickname ’Mini Khabib’ for flawlessly replicating the iconic weigh-in of&nbsp;professional MMA fighter </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Khabib Nurmagomedov</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This newfound moniker brought attention to&nbsp;their unique connection, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;collaborative content projects between the two.</p><p><strong>Despite facing the challenges of&nbsp;a&nbsp;debilitating condition that results in&nbsp;his unusually short stature, Hasbulla radiates confidence and charm. </strong>These qualities have become integral to&nbsp;his widespread popularity. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where physical appearances often define perceptions, Hasbulla’s ability to&nbsp;embrace himself and captivate audiences showcases the strength of&nbsp;character that transcends limitations.</p><p><strong>Hasbulla’s rise to&nbsp;social media stardom isn’t just about numbers; it’s a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the universal appeal of&nbsp;authenticity and humor.</strong> His journey from TikTok to&nbsp;Instagram, fueled by&nbsp;creativity and the ability to&nbsp;connect with others, highlights the positive impact one individual can have on&nbsp;a&nbsp;global scale. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world inundated with content, Hasbulla stands out for his condition and the genuine joy and laughter he&nbsp;brings millions worldwide.</p><p><h2>His condition is&nbsp;quite rare, but it&nbsp;does not hold him from reaching his dreams.</h2></p><p>Hasbulla Magomedov was born with a&nbsp;condition known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Growth Hormone Deficiency</a> (GHD), commonly referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;dwarfism. It’s important to&nbsp;clarify that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;condition, not a&nbsp;disease, as&nbsp;many people often search for “Hasbulla’s disease.” <strong>This condition gives the impression that Hasbulla is&nbsp;much younger than his actual age</strong>, leading to&nbsp;queries like “Is&nbsp;Hasbulla a&nbsp;kid?” popping up&nbsp;frequently. However, Hasbulla is&nbsp;unequivocally not a&nbsp;child; <strong>he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;21-year-old adult.</strong></p><p>GHD, the condition affecting Hasbulla, has also impacted other well-known sports figures, such as&nbsp;Lionel Messi. Messi was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed</a> with GHD at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;11&nbsp;and received human growth hormone (HGH) injections. While it’s not officially confirmed, Messi likely discontinued this treatment upon reaching adulthood, as&nbsp;HGH is&nbsp;a&nbsp;prohibited substance in&nbsp;sports.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;his dwarfism,<strong> Hasbulla stands at&nbsp;a&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>height</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;only 3&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches, equivalent to&nbsp;around 1&nbsp;meter.</strong> This physical characteristic, combined with his condition, contributes to&nbsp;the misconception of&nbsp;his age. <strong>Additionally, it’s estimated that Hasbulla weighs around 16&nbsp;kilograms, or&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;stone.</strong></p><p>Understanding the distinction between a&nbsp;condition and a&nbsp;disease is&nbsp;crucial when discussing Hasbulla’s unique situation. His journey, alongside other notable figures who share a&nbsp;similar condition, sheds light on&nbsp;the diversity of&nbsp;experiences within dwarfism and the importance of&nbsp;dispelling misconceptions surrounding&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;has a&nbsp;special relationship with UFC</h2></p><p><strong>In&nbsp;October, Hasbulla made headlines by&nbsp;inking a&nbsp;five-year deal with the </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>UFC</strong></a><strong> (Ultimate Fighting Championship), all while engaging in&nbsp;a&nbsp;heated social media spat with Irish fighter </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Conor McGregor</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Despite rumors circulating about a&nbsp;potential match between Hasbulla and another Internet personality with the same <a href=# title=disability data-link=tag>disability</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Abdu Rozik</a>, orchestrated by&nbsp;UFC president <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dana White</a>, this matchup never materialized.</p><p>However, the Internet sensation appears to&nbsp;have entered into a&nbsp;promotional <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agreement</a> with the UFC. <strong>Over the past few months, Hasbulla has graced several UFC events, marking his presence in&nbsp;the mixed martial arts scene.</strong> Notably, he&nbsp;was seen at&nbsp;UFC 280, a&nbsp;marquee event headlined by&nbsp;fighters <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Charles Oliveira</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Islam Makhachev</a>.</p><p>The diminutive star continued to&nbsp;capture attention when he&nbsp;attended the UFC Fight Night featuring <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Merab Dvalishvili</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Petr Yan</a>. This event culminated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;victory for Dvalishvili via unanimous decision. <strong>Hasbulla’s appearances at&nbsp;these high-profile UFC gatherings signify his growing association with the organization and the broader acceptance of&nbsp;his unique presence within the MMA community.</strong></p><p>His involvement in&nbsp;UFC events showcases his popularity and suggests a&nbsp;collaboration that goes beyond the typical athlete-promoter <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. Hasbulla’s journey from social media sensation to&nbsp;a&nbsp;visible figure in&nbsp;the UFC underlines the evolving landscape of&nbsp;entertainment and sports, where unconventional paths can lead to&nbsp;unexpected opportunities. <strong>As&nbsp;he&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fixture at&nbsp;UFC gatherings, it&nbsp;remains to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen how his partnership with the organization will unfold in&nbsp;the coming years.</strong></p><p><h2>His content is&nbsp;Internet’s favorite</h2></p><p>So, who is&nbsp;Hasbulla?
