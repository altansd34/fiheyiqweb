Immediately, Jennifer decided she would only sign with an&nbsp;agency if&nbsp;she got to&nbsp;act. “One of&nbsp;them gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;script, to&nbsp;audition the next day, and&nbsp;I read the script, and it&nbsp;was the first time&nbsp;I had that feeling like&nbsp;I understand this.” She even dropped out of&nbsp;middle school to&nbsp;pursue her passion.</p><p><h2>Her career immediately took off and she became a&nbsp;rising star.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8e/bce/98c4e25161bf65392f8ddb59cd.jpg><p>RE/Westcom/starmaxinc.com/East News</p><p>It&nbsp;didn’t take long for her to&nbsp;find success in&nbsp;the industry. Her first big break came with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Winter’s Bone</i></a> in&nbsp;2010, and she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> an&nbsp;Academy Award nomination for her role. The film also catapulted her into stardom, and she went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;more critically acclaimed films like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Silver Linings Playbook</i></a>, which also earned her an&nbsp;Academy Award for Best Actress in&nbsp;2013.</p><p><h2>The Hunger Games turned her into an&nbsp;icon.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/72b/e56/43e65d5db7a42de967be368f6d.jpg><p>Image supplied by Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS</p><p>Her most notable role to&nbsp;date, which she is&nbsp;still recognized for, is&nbsp;Katniss Everdeen in&nbsp;<i>The Hunger Games </i>series. After starring in&nbsp;4&nbsp;films, Jennifer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> the highest-grossing action heroine ever. At&nbsp;just 22&nbsp;years old, the actress quickly achieved fame and success, and her public persona also made her extremely popular with the general public.</p><p><h2>However, with fame came increased criticism.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c22/29a/88beab5b88a3b0487de628f405.jpg><p>Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>Her public image soon became a&nbsp;point of&nbsp;<a href=# title=critique data-link=tag>critique</a> after her famous trip on&nbsp;the stairs at&nbsp;the Oscars. The backlash targeted her persona, which many assumed was disingenuous and fake.</p><p>The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>felt</a> insecure about her public image. “It&nbsp;had just gotten to&nbsp;a&nbsp;point where&nbsp;I couldn’t do&nbsp;anything right. I&nbsp;just think everyone got sick of&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;got sick of&nbsp;myself. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;walked down the red carpet, it&nbsp;was like, ’Why didn’t she run?’”</p><p><h2>Jennifer realized she needed a&nbsp;break from the public.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8da/74f/21c8f757d2a9dcc063250e1a04.jpg><p>ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News</p><p>By&nbsp;2018, Jennifer had started <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>feeling</a> disappointed with her work. “I&nbsp;think that&nbsp;I was people-pleasing for the majority of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. And then&nbsp;I felt like&nbsp;I reached a&nbsp;point where people were not pleased just by&nbsp;my&nbsp;existence. So&nbsp;that kind of&nbsp;shook me&nbsp;out of&nbsp;thinking that work or&nbsp;your career can bring any kind of&nbsp;peace to&nbsp;your soul.”</p><p>This became her primary reason for taking a&nbsp;break in&nbsp;2019 and stepping away from the spotlight.</p><p><h2>Taking a&nbsp;break from the public eye helped her mentally.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14e/db5/80f48650b193f2434f6b3e7e52.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>The break helped her recover mentally and find a&nbsp;work-life balance she did not have before. Combined with a&nbsp;near-death experience in&nbsp;an&nbsp;airplane in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2017</a>, the actress felt that she “didn’t have a&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I should go&nbsp;get one.” By&nbsp;taking time away from the public eye and figuring out her priorities in&nbsp;life, the actress was able to&nbsp;find mental peace and return to&nbsp;the spotlight on&nbsp;her own terms.</p><p>Have you ever gotten to&nbsp;a&nbsp;point in&nbsp;your life where you felt nothing you did was right?
