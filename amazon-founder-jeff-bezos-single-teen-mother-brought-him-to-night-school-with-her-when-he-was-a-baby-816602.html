Today, we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share their story to&nbsp;inspire people and show that with <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> and determination, you can make seemingly impossible things happen.</p><p><h2>Jeff Bezos’ journey to&nbsp;success is&nbsp;inspiring, but so&nbsp;is&nbsp;his mom’s story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/5f8/69a/357c2c54fcaa298c691fa4398f.jpeg><p>Bezos, the third-richest person globally with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$167.8 billion</a> as&nbsp;of&nbsp;November 2023, had a&nbsp;tough start. His mom, Jacklyn Bezos, was a&nbsp;teenager without much <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a> and couldn’t even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>afford</a> a&nbsp;telephone.</p><p>Bezos <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tweeted</a> about his mom’s amazing journey, saying, “My&nbsp;mom’s incredible story. Wow. So&nbsp;grateful. So&nbsp;proud. #Grit.” He&nbsp;shared a&nbsp;clip of&nbsp;his mom’s speech at&nbsp;Cambridge <a href=# title=College data-link=tag>College</a>.</p><p>Jacklyn Bezos <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>got</a> pregnant when she was just 17&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title="high school" data-link=tag>high school</a> in&nbsp;Albuquerque, New Mexico. At&nbsp;that time, life wasn’t easy for pregnant teenagers. School administrators even told her she wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;finish high school.</p><p>In&nbsp;her commencement speech, Jacklyn <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, “It&nbsp;didn’t make any sense to&nbsp;me, so&nbsp;I pushed back<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>,</a> and&nbsp;I kept on&nbsp;pushing back. And eventually the school relented, they would allow me&nbsp;to&nbsp;come back to&nbsp;school, but there would be&nbsp;conditions.”</p><p><h2>The rules were harsh and dehumanizing for Jacklyn Bezos.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c21/dbb/a4f3615792944bfcbd25a82050.jpg><p>She had to&nbsp;arrive and depart school within 5&nbsp;minutes of&nbsp;the starting and finishing bells. She couldn’t talk to&nbsp;other students or&nbsp;eat lunch in&nbsp;the cafeteria, and she was told she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wouldn’t be&nbsp;allowed</a> to&nbsp;walk across the stage with her classmates to&nbsp;get her diploma. Despite these challenges, Jacklyn complied, persisted, and graduated.</p><p>Divorced from Bezos’ biological father, Ted Jorgensen, by&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;was just 17&nbsp;months old, Jacklyn sought out work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;secretary, having taken secretarial classes in&nbsp;the afternoons. Even though she was a&nbsp;terrible typist and couldn’t read her own shorthand, somebody actually hired her, and she got a&nbsp;job that paid $190 per month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/9fe/dda/efd2985fb397c12f6d5eb50cbe.jpeg><p>Jacklyn moved into her own apartment with her son, but money was tight, leaving her unable to&nbsp;afford a&nbsp;phone. Since her parents wanted to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;touch, her father came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;solution&nbsp;— a&nbsp;walkie-talkie. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>instructed</a> her to&nbsp;check in&nbsp;every day at&nbsp;7&nbsp;a.m.</p><p><strong>“That’s how we&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment...because I&nbsp;didn’t have to&nbsp;pay for a&nbsp;phone,” Jacklyn explained.</strong></p><p>Determined to&nbsp;pursue her education, Jacklyn enrolled in&nbsp;night school. She strategically selected classes based on&nbsp;professors who would allow her to&nbsp;bring her infant son to&nbsp;class.</p><p><h2>Jacklyn would show up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;infant and 2&nbsp;duffel bags.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/1b5/acc/128ba75445899035ba7c2db8ac.jpeg><p>She used to&nbsp;come with her baby and 2&nbsp;big bags. One bag held her books, and the other had baby stuff, like diapers and bottles. In&nbsp;the second bag, she had things to&nbsp;keep Jeff busy for a&nbsp;little while.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her classes, Jacklyn met her future husband, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mike Bezos</a>, who is&nbsp;now considered Jeff’s father even though he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not his biological dad.</p><p>When Mike got a&nbsp;job that required the family to&nbsp;move, Jacklyn had to&nbsp;put her dream of&nbsp;graduating from college on&nbsp;hold for many years. She felt a&nbsp;bit envious when she sent her own children off to&nbsp;college.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ff7/3ae/a5b1e4513ea66bd7263529adbd.jpeg><p>But eventually, Jacklyn decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;school. She said, “Finally, after delays and setbacks, I&nbsp;feasted at&nbsp;the table of&nbsp;higher education. And boy did I&nbsp;feast. I&nbsp;was relentless. I&nbsp;devoured my&nbsp;classes.”</p><p>More than 2&nbsp;decades after finishing high school, Jacklyn achieved her goal and graduated from college. She proudly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “When I&nbsp;graduated from the College of&nbsp;Saints Elizabeth at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;40, I&nbsp;had never been more proud of&nbsp;myself. I&nbsp;felt 10&nbsp;feet tall. Now that’s a&nbsp;gain of&nbsp;5&nbsp;feet, so&nbsp;that’s a&nbsp;pretty big gain from graduation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ff2/2fc/59dac3572b989bc0b3898c001b.jpeg><p>What an&nbsp;amazing story!
