They got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>engaged</a> in&nbsp;2010 and were married that same year, with their son, Flynn, born the following January. However, just a&nbsp;few years later, Bloom and Kerr announced their separation, finalizing their divorce in&nbsp;2013.</p><p>Orlando Bloom made it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clear</a> right after his split with Miranda Kerr that there was no&nbsp;animosity between them. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his interviews, the actor said that they would always love each other for the sake of&nbsp;their son and would support each other as&nbsp;parents. The 2&nbsp;are now <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considered</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;excellent co-parents. Kerr now even refers to&nbsp;Bloom as&nbsp;being “like a&nbsp;brother” and is&nbsp;happy with how things worked out.</p><p><h2>Later both found love again.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcb/475/1ad49559209c73d72466702ce8.jpg><p>After her separation and divorce from Orlando Bloom, Miranda Kerr <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> Evan Spiegel, the co-founder and CEO of&nbsp;Snapchat, in&nbsp;2017. The couple got married in&nbsp;an&nbsp;intimate ceremony in&nbsp;Los Angeles, and they now have 2&nbsp;children together.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, Orlando Bloom got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>engaged</a> to&nbsp;singer Katy Perry in&nbsp;2019 and welcomed a&nbsp;daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, the next year. However, the 2&nbsp;have not married as&nbsp;of&nbsp;yet. Nevertheless, they remain committed co-parents to&nbsp;their daughter Daisy.</p><p><h2>Miranda and Katy have bonded over motherhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec5/555/984d255c79936a5bdda64dd8ea.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;Miranda, she and Katy immediately liked each other. First, Perry and Kerr made their <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> ’<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram official</a>’ during a&nbsp;live stream where both discussed the blessings of&nbsp;motherhood. Since both gave birth in&nbsp;their new relationship and raised Kerr and Orlando’s son, they eventually bonded over motherhood.</p><p>For Miranda and Katy, having kids is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pure <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>life joy</a>. “The kids are my&nbsp;number one love. It’s just the best thing in&nbsp;the world, being a&nbsp;mom,” says Kerr, to&nbsp;which Perry adds, “It’s the best job. It’s the most fulfilling.... There was no&nbsp;feeling like the feeling when&nbsp;I had my&nbsp;daughter.”</p><p><h2>They support each other in&nbsp;their projects.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a83/c79/a63d315782bd480992fbae4ffe.jpg><p>Besides modeling, Miranda has her own skincare business called Kora Organics. And Katy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>huge fan</a> of&nbsp;her brand and participates in&nbsp;many&nbsp;PR <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>events</a> dedicated to&nbsp;her cosmetic line. The singer constantly shows support and appreciation to&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friend</a>: “One of&nbsp;the great things about being close to&nbsp;Miranda is&nbsp;I get to&nbsp;try out all her products, especially when her son comes home with them in&nbsp;his backpack.”</p><p><h2>They serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;modern blended family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fcf/04b/dde97e50b298fe749175a24352.jpg><p>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News<span>, </span>Sipa USA/Sipa USA/East News</p><p>Both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>families</a> don’t mind spending time together, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;special occasions.

And it&nbsp;seems like the 2&nbsp;couples are a&nbsp;perfect <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>match</a> for each other: “It’s incredible that [Orlando and&nbsp;I] have been able to&nbsp;find other partners who work really well with&nbsp;us,” Kerr said. “Evan and Orlando really get along just as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;Katy and&nbsp;I, so&nbsp;it’s such a&nbsp;blessing, and it&nbsp;doesn’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;any other way. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;harmonious, and you can be&nbsp;super kind.”</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sources</a> confirm that the women often spend holidays together. They also share parenting tips and have one-on-one girl talks. Katy calls Miranda “love,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adding</a> that “love comes in&nbsp;many family iterations.” She refers to&nbsp;her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sister and is&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;family with her: “I’m so&nbsp;grateful for our modern blended family. It’s like&nbsp;I gained another sister, one with whom&nbsp;I usually sidebar from the main family chat and agree with.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yoqaWZnpm8bq7LqKamq12axW6tzZ1koaGjYrC2vtGepa1lp56zpnnBnpqapZVis7O1xKebrGWRo7FuwNSrpZ6cXZ67tbuMmmSbpJWjsaawjJ%2BYpqGcrnp5fZBtbXJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
