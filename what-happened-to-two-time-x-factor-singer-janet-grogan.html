In 2014, she made it to the six chair challenge, but was sent home by Simon Cowell. In 2016, she made it through to the judges’ houses, but didn’t make it into the live shows. It’s been five years since her time on the X Factor UK, what is she up to now?</strong></p><p>Before <a href=#>X Factor UK</a>, this singer studied Pop Music Design at Popakademie Baden-Württemberg in Mannheim, Germany in 2008 as an exchange student. In 2009, she wrote a song for Xavier Naidoo’s fifth studio album, Alles kann besser werden. Alles kann besser werden was not only the title track of the album, it also charted in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.</p><p>In 2014, Janet auditioned for the X Factor UK for the first time. In this audition she sang “I Can’t Make You Love Me” by Bonnie Raitt. She met Cowell for the first time and got him to crack a smile with her voice. The judge loved her, but ended up replacing her during his six chair challenge round.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In 2016, Janet re-auditioned for the X Factor for redemption. She noted on the series that her redemption was based off the fact that Cowell tweeted admitting his mistake. As we all know, it’s not everyday this talent show mogul accepts the fact that he was wrong.</p><p>She once again, Janet showed off her beautiful low register and jazzy tone in her 2016 audition. This powerhouse vocalist was amazing during each of her X Factor UK attempts, and she continues to sing in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-janet-s-journey-on-last-singer-standing>Janet’s Journey on Last Singer Standing</h2><p>After the series, Janet continued to pursue professional music. On social media, she posts an occasional cover of popular music. This year she created a TikTok channel with the same intent as her other social media.</p><p>Recently, Janet has been one of the singers on RTÉ’s TV show, Last Singer Standing. This show is a singing competition show based in Ireland. This series begins with eight players, in the first episode one singer performs a song while their opponents buzz in and challenge them. After their song is finished the singer chooses an opponent to face off against. At the end of the episode the panel votes on who is progressing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Rounds of this competition are all formatted similarly but feature a different form of voting. Some weeks the panel votes, others the audience votes. At round three, four new players join the competition. After seven weeks of this game, there are seven champions standing. They won all of their face offs. In the last episode the champions have to battle it out to win the full series. At the end, votes from the studio audience, panel and 25 eliminated contestants picks the winner of the competition. The person crowned as the winner of the series takes home a cash prize of €25,000.</p><p>Janet has officially placed sixth within her other 32 opponents. This Irish singing competition began in October and recently concluded on Dec 11. Janet gave some pretty great performances on this show, but my favorite had to be her final performance of “<a href=#>Dance With Somebody</a>” by Whitney Houston.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1342577765.jpg alt="JoJo Gets Engaged on Christmas — Who is Her Fiancé Dexter Darden?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>x factor uk</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2LBuLuMraCmnV2teqetwq2mq2WjnruosdFmoZqmlal6qL7OoJinZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
