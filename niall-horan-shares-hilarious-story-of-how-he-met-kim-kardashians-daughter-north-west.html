While sitting on the red chair, the “Slow Hands” singer detailed his first encounter with Kim and North West.</p><p>“You know the first time I met Kim Kardashian, I was backstage at an Ariana Grande concert,” he said. “Kim brought North and this is how Kim introduced North to me. ‘North, this is the guy that sings from your toothbrush.'”</p><p>Soon after his story, the studio audience and the coaches burst into laughter. Apparently, the “All Of Me” hitmaker was amused that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Direction</a> used to have battery-powered singing toothbrushes as merch.</p><p>“You guys had singing toothbrushes?!” Legend said.</p><p>“Oh did we what,” Horan replied.</p><p>Amid the interesting conversation, the contestant on stage chimed in, “I had one too.”</p><p>Then, Stefani was heard in the background, saying “No way, she had one.”</p><p>Every fan that grew up in the One Direction era knows exactly which toothbrushes they were talking about, Tooth Tunes. The company created the musical toothbrushes that would play exactly 2 minutes of a song, to help children brush fully. The line was discontinued in 2007.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-ready-to-win-another-season-of-the-voice>He’s Ready to “Win Another Season” of The Voice</h2><p>As Horan returns as coach for The Voice season 24, he’s on a mission to get his second win in his sophomore year. As early as now, the singer-songwriter is already claiming his victory.</p><p>“Champ’s here !! Time to win another season @nbcthevoice #TEAMNIALL,” he wrote in an Instagram post.</p><p>As he gears up for this season, he’s taking everything he’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> from former coach Blake Shelton. The country crooner has served as a great role model for the pop singer in terms coaching on the show.</p><p>“I learned a lot from Blake last year sitting next to him,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> NBC Insider. “That’s what they tend to do: stick everyone down beside Blake if you’re new. I learned a lot from even just watching him. Nothing that he said. Just watching how he does it. I think that made a lot of difference to how I’ve been in the show this year.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1350418860.jpg alt="Lizzo Demands Court to Dismiss Harassment Lawsuits, Asks for Jury Trial" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKYpaRdnbyzrc1mqqGZoprAbrTIpZiroZ%2BqwG6%2F06ipsmWfm3qpu9Zmn55lnZrBbrfIpmSkmaKZrrS0yJqlrGWUlsKotNOeqWamn6fBqXnWnqqtZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
