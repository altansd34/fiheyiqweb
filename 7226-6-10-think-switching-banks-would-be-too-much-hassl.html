One in three (35%) would be more likely to switch if they could take their current account number to the new bank. Of those who have switched already, 60% found the process easy and 50% said it took little time.</p><p>However, only 15% of consumers are aware of changes to the switching legislation, and only 7% have seen the switching logo.</p><p>Simon Mottram, director of financial and professional services at YouGov, said: “Consumers clearly see switching their current account as something onerous. It will be interesting to see how this perception changes after Monday, when banks will be required to complete a switch in seven days. We will likely see a more competitive marketplace, with more banks trying to differentiate themselves and make it worthwhile for consumers to switch. The introduction of TSB into the marketplace this week provides another option, but without clear and compelling reasons to switch a lot of consumers are still going to ask themselves, ‘Why would I?’.”</p><p>On November 4th, YouGov will release a market intelligence report, ‘Current Accounts: Barriers to Switching’, which will examine trends in consumer thinking and behaviour on switching their current accounts.</p><p><a href=#>Learn more about the CASH tracker</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZ2d%2Fd3mVZmhpZaSdtq%2B3jKyuoqyTnbavs4ybmKejo2LEsMHLnWSbnV2pvLB5zK6aoWWYlsC0uA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
