According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Philippe</a>, he&nbsp;had always been complimented on&nbsp;how good he&nbsp;looked, so&nbsp;at&nbsp;age&nbsp;60, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;take them at&nbsp;their word and pursue a&nbsp;modeling career. Fortunately, he&nbsp;was welcomed with open arms and is&nbsp;now the face of&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous perfume, jewelry, and clothing brands.</p><p><h2>2. At&nbsp;62, Nickelson Wooster is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;trendsetter.</h2></p><p>Nick has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a> in&nbsp;the fashion industry since he&nbsp;was 16. He’s always been passionate about clothing, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;worked in&nbsp;a&nbsp;clothing store when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager. He&nbsp;later graduated from college with a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;journalism and advertising; however, he&nbsp;designed and sold clothing for major brands like Calvin Klein until he&nbsp;founded his own fashion consulting firm. Today, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;trendsetter that keeps taking the Internet by&nbsp;surprise with his style and appeal.</p><p><h2>3.
