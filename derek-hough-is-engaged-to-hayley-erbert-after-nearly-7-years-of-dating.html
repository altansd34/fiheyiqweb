This couple has <a href=#>sparked</a> plenty of engagement and marriage rumors in the past, so fans are happy to see them set to wed.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-derek-hough-pops-the-question-to-hayley-erbert>Derek Hough Pops The Question to Hayley Erbert</h2><p>On June 2, Derek Hough revealed that he is engaged to his girlfriend of nearly seven years, Hayley Erbert. The social media announcement comes with an intimate photo featuring Erbert in Hough’s arms, with perfectly color coordinated decorations surrounding them. This photo is so special because they’re clearly enjoying the moment. Hough captioned the photo saying that “it’s only the beginning… the beginning of forever.”</p><p>Reports state that Troy Williams of Simply Troy Lifestyle + Events helped plan the unforgettable moment.</p><p>“The proposal happened last Monday. Derek surprised her and got her out of the house for the afternoon. He wanted their home transformed,” he <a href=#>said</a>. They’re an adventurous couple and have seen such big moments, but their home is their sanctuary and it’s where they fell even more in love.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CeT34pBpGA2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Reportedly, Erbert left the house thinking she was going to surprise Hough for his birthday later that evening. As soon as she left, Hough and Williams totally transformed the room. To achieve the look, they used 202 candles, flowers, white roses, white peonies, and nude champagne roses. Each decoration matched the colors of their home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Are Happy They’re Finally Engaged</h2><p>Marriage rumors sparked for this couple last December due to an anonymous tip on an Instagram gossip account, Deuxmoi. At the time, the account shared a screenshot stating that a big network TV judge would be marrying his longtime girlfriend that month. Hints within the post included details of their ages, as well as how long they’ve been together. Pretty much all of Reddit believed this was true until today’s engagement confirmation.</p><p>Erbert and Hough began dating in July 2015 after first meeting at Derek and Julianne Hough’s Move Live Tour a year prior. A year into their relationship, Erbert joined the cast of Dancing With the Stars alongside her boyfriend.</p><p>This engagement has been in the making for years, whether the couple knew it or not. Hough has continually faked proposal announcements in the media since explaining that he felt no pressure to walk down the aisle. The dancer joked that he would propose before the start of 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis, and at their Las Vegas residency.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-903109164.jpg alt="Mama June Loses Custody of Honey Boo Boo to Daughter Pumpkin" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Celebrity</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w56pnqNdnby2s8dmoKxllaO0orPEnWStp12drrq4xLJknqqSmr%2B1ecCfq56qXaOyor7LsmRwZamarrO%2FjKidZpyRqbavs44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
