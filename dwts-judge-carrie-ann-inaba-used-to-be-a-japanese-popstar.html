Yet, who would’ve thought that this judge also aced singing pop music before? Here’s what we know about her past musical journey.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-carrie-ann-inaba-was-a-famous-japanese-recording-artist>Carrie Ann Inaba was a Famous Japanese Recording Artist</h2><p>In Inaba’s latest appearance with Live with Kelly and Ryan, she spilled some details about her life as a Japanese singer in the 80’s. Apparently, the DWTS judge used to be big in Tokyo, where she jumpstarted her career as a young woman.</p><p>“I don’t know if I was a mega, but like fame happened really quickly,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Inaba debuted on Yoru No Hit Studio, a music variety program that ran two-hour live specials along with several recording artists. Subsequently, prominence rapidly took over for Inaba, with people loving her the day after she performed in the show.</p><p>“The next day it was like I went shopping in Harajuku,” she said. “And the window was filled with people screaming my name and it was actually a little scary.”</p><p>Contrary to her long and wavy hair now, Inaba used to sport a boy cut which she did just on her own. Meanwhile, among the three singles she released was “Be Your Girl,” talking about “falling in love with a guy on a skateboard.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Later Realized She’s Meant for Dancing</h2><p>Last April, Inaba shared on Instagram as throwback photo, in which she was beside mentor Mari Yoshimura. According to the DWTS judge, that singing stint began her love for television.</p><p>“I love the thrill of live tv and I still do…Grateful for these memories,” she wrote.</p><p>However, her pop singer persona didn’t last much longer, deliberately shying away from the public eye. Eventually, she discovered her passion for dancing, thus the decision to go back to America.</p><p>“It was kind of a cool experience, but I didn’t like fame,” she said. “I realized that I wanted to dance more so I left the recording artist and came back and wanted to study dance.”</p><p>Today, Inaba is one of the original judges in Dancing With The Stars along with Len Goodman and <a href=#>Bruno Tonioli</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_HayleyErbert_DerekHough_David-LivingstonWireImage.jpg alt="Derek Hough, Hayley Erbert Premiere Dreamy New Dance to ‘Kiss the Girl’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWaqrGosYycmKuqmZp6orrNZqCnmZKWera%2FxJ1kraddl7JurYyjmKmZnprApnnPqKesrJGnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
