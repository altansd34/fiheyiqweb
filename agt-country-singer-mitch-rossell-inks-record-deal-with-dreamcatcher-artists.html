The America’s Got Talent country singer announced he’s signed a deal with the record label over the weekend.</strong></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mitch-rossell-signs-record-deal-after-agt-stint>Mitch Rossell Signs Record Deal After AGT Stint</h2><p>On Instagram, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rossell</a> revealed the “biggest announcement” he’s made in his career thus far. Alongside a series of snaps, he wrote a long and emotional caption reflecting on his personal journey.</p><p>“I moved to Nashville almost 14 years ago, and man it has been quite the ride,” Rossell wrote. “I’ve had a lot of ups, and a LOT of downs. I’ve felt like it was all coming together a few times, and I’ve felt like quitting a bunch of times.”</p><p>The singer went on and stated that he’s always taken a blue-collar approach when it comes to navigating his career, knowing that “God was in ultimate control.” He went on to express his initial doubt to sign a record deal because he fears losing his creative freedom. However, after meeting people from Dreamcatcher, he was convinced about their vision.</p><p>“So today, I am so incredibly proud to announce, that I have signed a record deal with Dreamcatcher Artists. I am so pumped to have a team of people who truly want the world to know me and my music and they’re excited at what we can accomplish. And let me just tell y’all, I’m excited too,” he wrote.</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rossell</a> and Dreamcatcher Artists begin their artistic venture, the AGT singer trusts that respect will foster. As he said, the record label is “willing to walk alongside me and make those same dreams and goals a part of their mission.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-thanks-fans-for-the-continuous-support>He Thanks Fans for the Continuous Support</h2><p>It’s worth noting that during his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> stint, Rossell has attracted a number of fans. In the same post, Rossell took the chance to express his appreciation for his followers for the support.</p><p>“I’m sharing this with y’all because I want to say thank you,” he said. “I would not be here without y’all. You have walked alongside me and helped me create a meaningful career where I can support my family and chase my dreams.”</p><p>Rossell continued and hoped that his fans will resume to walk with him and help his team to “push this train,”</p><p>“Together, I truly believe we can change the world,” he said.</p><p>Before Rossell auditioned for AGT season 18, he already had a good start in the music industry. He has written hit singles for country music legend Garth Brooks. Furthermore, he has performed in front of a big crowd in support of Brooks.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AGT-Atlanta-Drum-Academy1-220x146.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Recap: Live Shows Continue with Two Golden Buzzer Acts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Mitch Rossell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZpufqru1vthmqqKml5q%2FbrnIrZqhZaKkwLSxy6VkoqabqHqzscKoqZ1llJqurXnWoquhZZSnsqK5wpqrnKCVp3qivtOiqq2rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
