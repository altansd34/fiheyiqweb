While it is complicated to get the right answer, you <a href=#>can</a> end the entire debate by looking at all the aspects involved in this much-followed sport.</p><h2>Is wrestling real or acting?</h2><p class=align-left>Like Hollywood movies or <a href=#>TV shows</a>, wrestling is a scripted sport with predetermined match results and a pre-written storyline, and wrestlers must follow the script while keeping it super-entertaining.</p><p class=align-left>When discussing professional wrestling, it's impossible to ignore World Wrestling <a href=#>Entertainment</a> (WWE), the industry's largest and most well-known promotion. The WWE is often at the centre of the debate surrounding the authenticity of wrestling.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c4abf4892c92cb5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>German circus replaces live animals with holograms</span></p></a><h3>Is WWE wrestling real or acted?</h3><p class=align-left>While WWE superstars undoubtedly possess incredible athletic abilities, the outcomes of their matches are scripted. Wrestlers work together to choreograph the action, ensuring a safe and entertaining performance for the audience.</p><p class=align-left>It also means wrestlers stay in their true characters that their fans know them for. Professional <a href=#>WWE wrestlers </a>always strive to maintain certain personas when interacting with their fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c4abf4892c92cb5.jpg><h4>How real is WWE wrestling?</h4><p class=align-left>Several companies have tried to put up their wrestling competitions, but none have come close to WWE. That means while wrestling might have some fake elements, at least professional wrestlers understand their assignment and work towards creating an entertaining match.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, some wrestlers, such as John Cena and <a href=#>Roman Reigns</a>, are considered good or heroic, while others, like Undertaker, are considered dangerous or bad.</p><p class=align-left>Wrestlers must maintain their kayfabe while on stage to keep things as real as possible. For example, in most cases, <a href=#>John Cena</a> was seen fighting against evil to keep his good-guy character.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/21ccc48ff71597a9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Netflix finally finds a manga hit with 'One Piece'</span></p></a><h3>How real is wrestling itself?</h3><p class=align-left>Although the wrestling storyline might be scripted, what remains real are the wrestlers themselves and their actions in the ring. Most fans are thrilled by their stars' kicks, punches, wrestling garments, and defence tactics.</p><p class=align-left>Wrestlers also end up in hot situations with blood, bruises, and sweat. All these are real aspects visible in any sport. Moreover, unlike <a href=#>movie actors</a> who have stuntmen to take their risky parts, professional wrestlers do not have stuntmen and expose themselves to all the potential risks involved in the ring.</p><h3>Is wrestling real or fake?</h3><p class=align-left>While wrestling may not be a legitimate sporting competition, it is "real" in the sense that the performers' physicality, athleticism, and dedication are genuine. Wrestlers endure gruelling training regimens, suffer real injuries, and put on physically demanding performances night after night. Their athleticism is very much a reality.</p><h3>How much of wrestling is real?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f46fb7c4d878d3fe.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>23 weird movies that will make your everyday life seem ordinary</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The degree of realness in wrestling can vary.
