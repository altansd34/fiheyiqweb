We also know that Klum is no stranger to love. In 1997, she married actor Ric Pipino. In 2005, she tied the knot with musician Seal, with whom she shares three children. Now, Klum is married to Tom Kaulitz. The two tied the knot in 2019. Here’s everything you should know about Klum’s latest hubby.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-klum-and-kaulitz-met-through-germany-s-next-top-model>Klum and Kaulitz Met Through Germany’s Next Top Model</h2><p>In 2018, Kaulitz was introduced to Klum by a mutual friend on Germany’s Next Top Model. Their relationship became official soon after, and the couple made their first public appearance together at a designer’s party.</p><p>Since then, the two have been spotted holding hands and kissing on several occasions, including on the set of America’s Got Talent. Kaulitz proposed after eight months of dating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-klum-s-new-spouse-is-also-german>Klum’s New Spouse is also German</h2><p>Interestingly, Klum’s new spouse comes from a very similar background. In an <a href=#>interview</a>, Kaulitz dished on the similarities of their German upbringing.</p><p>“Heidi and I we have the same upbringing, we are both from a little small village,” he said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CTIlCKHCqFQ/</p></figure><p>Kaulitz went on to explain how they are from different parts of Germany, but love the same foods. The couple also uses German words when referring to the pet names they have for one another. Kaulitz calls his wife “hase,” which translates to bunny, while Klum refers to him as “schnecke,” which means snail.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-kaulitz-is-a-musician>Tom Kaulitz is a Musician</h3><p>Tom Kaulitz is a guitarist, songwriter and composer. He is best known for his work in <a href=#>Tokio Hotel</a>. Their sound encompasses multiple genres including pop rock, alternative rock, and electronic rock.

In 2018, the AGT judge addressed the age gap in an <a href=#>interview</a>:</p><p>“My boyfriend is many years younger than me, and lots of people are questioning that and asking about it,” she said. “That’s really the only time when age seems to be shoved in my face and I have to give an answer for it. I don’t really think about it that much otherwise. You have to just live a happy life without worrying too much about what people think because worrying is only going to give you&nbsp;more&nbsp;wrinkles.”</p><p>The couple continues to shut down the haters while basking in their love-filled relationship.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-gave-his-wife-a-very-special-birthday-gift>He Gave His Wife a Very Special Birthday Gift</h3><p>Ahead of Klum’s June 1, 2021 birthday, Kaulitz gifted his wife something very special, and very odd, a piece of the Berlin Wall. On an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the judge showed the crowd a photo of her extraordinary present.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“It’s the German wall! It’s the Berlin German Wall. My husband was actually born in East Berlin, and I’ve been there many, many times,” Klum said on the show. “Obviously, I love Germany. This is where I’m from even though I’ve been here longer than I’ve been in Germany. So he gave this to me for my birthday. I loved it. It’s beautiful. I mean it’s beautiful that it’s broken and it’s not standing there anymore doing what they intended it to do, so I love it as an art piece in the garden.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1331023694.jpg alt="Luke Bryan Celebrates 27th Number One Hit With “Waves”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>heidi klum</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYrWmtcOiZKSkpaLAbrTUrJmappRitKbAjK2mZqOepMRus8SrpJqmXaLCtLXCopinZaSkum63wK6joqyqZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
