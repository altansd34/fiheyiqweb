She’s been real about the ups and downs of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;single mom, showing she’s just like the rest of&nbsp;us when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;dealing with the tough parts of&nbsp;parenting. But, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent interview, Halle got super honest about the whole pressure that many women feel to&nbsp;become moms, reaching out to&nbsp;all those who can relate.</p><p><h2>She has learned to&nbsp;raise her kids as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9d/3c5/187086585488a22b7354b3c74b.jpg><p>The actress and super mom of&nbsp;two opened up&nbsp;about finding her happy place as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single lady, while giving her all to&nbsp;raise her two awesome kids. During an&nbsp;Instagram live, Halle got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>real</a> about the <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a> behind her choice to&nbsp;go&nbsp;it&nbsp;alone since her split with ex-husband Olivier Martinez in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2016</a>.</p><p>It’s like catching a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;her inner strength and the deep love she’s pouring into her family&nbsp;— a&nbsp;reminder that life’s journey can lead&nbsp;us to&nbsp;the most beautiful places. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I’ve learned a&nbsp;lot about being with my&nbsp;children. They are the best company for me&nbsp;right now, and when&nbsp;I divorced Maceo’s dad, I’ve been pretty alone by&nbsp;myself going on&nbsp;three years now, decidedly&nbsp;so, for sure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cb/ce1/99692153808a6b4c7dc084e1ae.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;no longer feel the need for a&nbsp;relationship, so&nbsp;I don’t feel the need to&nbsp;rush or&nbsp;accept something that’s not totally right for&nbsp;me,” Halle <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>. “Not that anything’s wrong with the people I’ve been with, but I’m going to&nbsp;wait for my&nbsp;match, or&nbsp;I will stay solo and be&nbsp;with my&nbsp;kids and do&nbsp;my&nbsp;life the way I’m doing&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Berry dropped some real wisdom, like the kind you’d get from your coolest friend. She says she’s done rushing into relationships that don’t light her&nbsp;up. It’s like she’s waving a&nbsp;flag for self-worth and that you can be&nbsp;strong, independent, and totally content in&nbsp;your own skin.</p><p><h2>Halle loved being pregnant.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4f/a95/1f732b5c7b8f5ddba418cb2263.jpg><p>Honopix,PacificCoastNews.com/EAST NEWS</p><p>Halle Berry didn’t hold back when talking about her pregnancy journey. She spilled the beans about how much she loved being pregnant, saying it&nbsp;made her feel like a&nbsp;total powerhouse. Berry, first stepped into motherhood at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;40&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2008</a>, and then she unexpectedly welcomed her second baby in&nbsp;2013.</p><p>She gushed about pregnancy, “All the hormones made me&nbsp;feel amazing. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;alive with my&nbsp;purpose and my&nbsp;femininity. It&nbsp;felt like my&nbsp;body was doing what it&nbsp;was built to&nbsp;do.” And also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, “Loved being pregnant and probably would have had five children if&nbsp;I had started earlier.”</p><p><h2>There’s no&nbsp;rush for motherhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/efc/655/fd181e568aaadb261aff501e4b.jpg><p>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;different note, even though Halle totally gets the amazingness of&nbsp;being pregnant and having your own kids, she also talked excitedly about how crucial it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;figure out the perfect timing for becoming a&nbsp;mom.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>highlighted</a> the importance of&nbsp;not rushing into things and making that decision wisely. “<strong>You’re so&nbsp;much more ready to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent after 40&nbsp;than when you’re 20</strong>. You know yourself better. You’ve done a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things for yourself. When you wait later in&nbsp;life, you can really put your kids forward, I&nbsp;think, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;more meaningful way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5d/c31/15d3a6570e8c21e9fce5cfd493.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where people can’t stop talking about the “right time” to&nbsp;have kids, Halle’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I’m solidly in&nbsp;my&nbsp;womanhood. I&nbsp;finally realize what&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;say is&nbsp;valuable, even if&nbsp;no&nbsp;one else agrees. Here’s what&nbsp;I tell women: Own wherever you are.”</p><p>She’s giving a&nbsp;high-five to&nbsp;women everywhere, reminding them that they’ve got the power to&nbsp;make choices that make sense for them. Halle’s words are like a&nbsp;breath of&nbsp;fresh air, cutting through the noise and claiming, “If&nbsp;you’re in&nbsp;your mid-thirties, don’t be&nbsp;bogged down by&nbsp;the idea that you have to&nbsp;have children by&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain age.” Adding, “You decide. And if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;have children, you don’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;defined by&nbsp;those old ideologies that this is&nbsp;what women ‘have’ to&nbsp;do.”</p><p>The actress totally rocks at&nbsp;being a&nbsp;mom, no&nbsp;doubt about that. But what’s even more mind-blowing is&nbsp;how she keeps her skin looking <a href=#>youthful</a> and timeless without breaking a&nbsp;sweat—and she’s spilling all her tricks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWiuMueZJudoqfGbr%2FAsqpmr5%2Bisq950qGmrqSUo8FussSeo2aooprAtMHRnptmmZKkwrV5wZqZop2jYravedOhnKKqXWh9tHnAp5tmnailuaK1zaxksKCpYoVygJZucGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
