Her youngest daughter, Natalie, was using only the lower part of&nbsp;her arm. What Nicole didn’t anticipate when she brought her daughter to&nbsp;the emergency room was the shocking diagnosis of&nbsp;stage 4&nbsp;<a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;mother learned that her 2-year-old girl had cancer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d03/19b/2172615bb8975d85a384d9121e.jpg><p>When a&nbsp;mother Nicole <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dodge</a> first noticed her 2-year-old daughter moving her arm strangely, she never anticipated receiving the diagnosis she did. In&nbsp;2022, she observed Natalie was using only the lower half of&nbsp;her arm. “I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I was crazy,” she shared.</p><p>Initially, Nicole suspected it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;shoulder injury. However, the symptoms persisted, leading them to&nbsp;seek medical advice.</p><p>The doctors said that Natalie presumably has cancer. Nicole recalls, “I&nbsp;was like, ’What?’ I&nbsp;felt like the rug was ripped out from underneath&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Natalie’s survival chance was only 50&nbsp;percent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/098/eb8/76d64f51ed8570878ffa80f334.jpg><p>Four days later, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dodges</a> received the call with Natalie’s test results. “It&nbsp;was high risk or&nbsp;stage 4&nbsp;neuroblastoma. It’s MYCN amplified, which means that her type of&nbsp;cancer grows at&nbsp;10&nbsp;times the rate of&nbsp;regular neuroblastoma.”</p><p>Nicole expresses, “It&nbsp;was essentially the worst prognosis that we&nbsp;could have gotten. I&nbsp;absolutely lost&nbsp;it. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I just went to&nbsp;our bedroom and sobbed. It&nbsp;was awful. We&nbsp;felt like there was absolutely no&nbsp;hope at&nbsp;that point.” Dodge shares that the oncologist informed her that even if&nbsp;they pursued entry into a&nbsp;clinical trial, Natalie’s best chance of&nbsp;survival was only 50&nbsp;percent.</p><p><h2>Fortunately, they found a&nbsp;clinic that showed a&nbsp;high cure rate.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3be/3bb/0f9df55d8eb7da73329710dbc1.jpg><p>When the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dodges</a> arrived for Natalie’s appointment, their fortunes took a&nbsp;dramatic turn.</p><p>“Our doctor walked right in&nbsp;and said&nbsp;I have some really great news,” she says. The doctor told her about another clinic which was running studies and their survival rate is&nbsp;over 80&nbsp;percent. And they were ready to&nbsp;accept the Natalie. “Our whole world just changed in&nbsp;the blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye again,” Nicole says. “And I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband and I&nbsp;said, ’We have to&nbsp;go.’”</p><p>In&nbsp;under a&nbsp;week, Dodge and her daughter embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;700-mile journey to&nbsp;this clinic where they spent over 10&nbsp;months undergoing treatment.</p><p><h2>Finally, little Natalie has recovered.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70c/92c/1996a75c229989356b86dc4e49.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Finally</a>, after the first five rounds of&nbsp;chemotherapy and immunotherapy, Natalie was declared “having no&nbsp;evidence of&nbsp;disease,” and she has consistently shown clear scans.</p><p>“It’s truly remarkable,” Nicole states. “I&nbsp;have seen other protocols at&nbsp;other hospitals around the world, and there are not as&nbsp;many kids having that NED status so&nbsp;early in&nbsp;treatment elsewhere, as&nbsp;I’ve seen at&nbsp;this clinic.”</p><p>Dodge expresses her gratitude to&nbsp;her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a>, and <a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a> for their support throughout this challenging journey, and she finds solace in&nbsp;sharing Natalie’s story on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, which has been therapeutic and serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;how far they’ve come.</p><p>Another <a href=#>mother</a> Kaitlin Burge whose son received a&nbsp;cancer diagnosis, shared a&nbsp;heart-wrenching photo of&nbsp;her son being comforted by&nbsp;his older sister during chemotherapy. That was more than two years ago, and after a&nbsp;challenging and exhausting fight, young Beckett has now fully recovered and is&nbsp;attending school.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGwsMOlnKurXajCpbDEp2SbnZiWw6q70WaaoZmenLJuvsSvnJqko2LAta3GnmRtZZOWu6Sx0WalqK9dqbWmecyopGavkae7tHnApaNmqJGnsq%2FA0mZvam5gaIRw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
