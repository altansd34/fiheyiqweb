However, looking at&nbsp;it&nbsp;closer, some people saw concerning things that let them wonder how he’s doing health-wise.</p><p><h2>Only those with sharp eyes managed to&nbsp;spot&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e8/4f0/18f6e657a0a363158c1ae3229d.jpg><p>Cristiano Ronaldo was on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>vacation</a> with his family on&nbsp;a&nbsp;secluded island when he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;few photos with his fans on&nbsp;Instagram. Besides giving a&nbsp;sneak peek into his quality time with family on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach-side resort, he&nbsp;also showed how he’s taking time to&nbsp;help his body recover from the intensity of&nbsp;professional soccer matches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/157/63d/5b36c3541b95d87bb5dee95e0c.jpg><p>One photo in&nbsp;particular, captioned with «Recharging,» shows him lying down with his bare feet by&nbsp;a&nbsp;pool. Although the situation itself is&nbsp;pretty ordinary, people online think the state of&nbsp;Ronaldo’s feet is&nbsp;not good.</p><p>A&nbsp;fan took to&nbsp;X (formerly known as&nbsp;Twitter) to&nbsp;express worry over the fact that his feet seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;deformed. «22&nbsp;years of&nbsp;pro football and look at&nbsp;this man’s feet,» the user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>. «He&nbsp;wakes up&nbsp;with crazy pain everyday for sure.»</p><p>Others agreed, but also recognized that it’s part of&nbsp;his job as&nbsp;an&nbsp;athlete and that it’s a&nbsp;choice he&nbsp;made consciously. «He&nbsp;wears boots that are like two sizes too small for him because he&nbsp;likes the feel, this is&nbsp;what happens to&nbsp;your feet when you do&nbsp;that for 22&nbsp;years,» someone else <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, with the information being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>backed up</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;media reports. «One of&nbsp;the many sacrifices he’s made to&nbsp;stay on&nbsp;top.»</p><p><h2>Players’ sometimes complain about the state of&nbsp;their feet after a&nbsp;match.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c6/c09/90b23b569d96ba5225429525a8.jpg><p>Adam Lallana, an&nbsp;English Premier League player who currently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plays</a> for Brighton &&nbsp;Hove Albion, once went viral for posting a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;his feet right after a&nbsp;match. In&nbsp;2018, then a&nbsp;Liverpool player, Lallana showed the not-so-glamorous side of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;professional soccer player.</p><p>After he&nbsp;played on&nbsp;a&nbsp;wet and cold winter day his feet weren’t the prettiest sight. However, what’s most shocking of&nbsp;all is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;didn’t even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>play</a> the entirety of&nbsp;the 90-minute match. He&nbsp;came on&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;substitute around the 70th minute and so&nbsp;only played for about 20&nbsp;minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/326/0a6/f964b65a33b30a26cedd3e41c6.jpg><p>Jokingly, he&nbsp;turned to&nbsp;Instagram to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ask</a> for «Any suggestions for defrosting feet,» and ended up&nbsp;leaving people stunned at&nbsp;the toll his feet had taken. Besides having bright white toes from the cold, in&nbsp;the photo it’s visible a&nbsp;large bruise and a&nbsp;band-aid covering his right big toe as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Someone reacting to&nbsp;the photo expressed that the real condition of&nbsp;players’ feet is&nbsp;very rarely talked about, particularly how it&nbsp;impacts the way they play on&nbsp;the field. «Lallana’s toes are examples of&nbsp;little niggles that fans like&nbsp;us will never hear&nbsp;of,» they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pointed out</a>.</p><p>«It&nbsp;explains sometimes why players switch feet before shooting, scuff shots, mishandle passes, etc. People who’ve had no&nbsp;direct exposure to&nbsp;football, even at&nbsp;lower levels, cannot imagine the kind of&nbsp;bumps and bruises players receive in&nbsp;every game&nbsp;— and this is&nbsp;even before we&nbsp;consider pinching, which is&nbsp;so&nbsp;prevalent in&nbsp;lower league games,» they concluded.</p><p><h2>It’s common for players’ feet to&nbsp;be&nbsp;affected by&nbsp;years of&nbsp;playing soccer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd4/c3b/c5cefb58f28f12f94d7bf2353b.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>podiatrist</a> with a&nbsp;decade of&nbsp;experience working with English Premier League clubs, many players opt for undersized boots to&nbsp;enhance ball contact and minimize foot movement, leading to&nbsp;toe bunching, calluses, and heightened blistering—a common yet uncomfortable outcome.</p><p>But that’s not all. The lightweight and flexible material with which modern boots are made of&nbsp;increases the risk of&nbsp;damage caused by&nbsp;opponents from fouls or&nbsp;accidental run-ins. That alone can leave them blood trapped underneath their toenails. And «when they get stamped on&nbsp;by&nbsp;opposing players, they get thick toenails,» the expert added.</p><p>Every little thing can lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;major injury as&nbsp;well, because even something as&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;a&nbsp;blister can make players offload their weight to&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;their foot, and therefore risk developing Achilles issues and stress fractures as&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/964/99e/409ac752f198dd9127f295702d.jpg><p>Top-tier footballers, often featured in&nbsp;major boot advertisements like Ronaldo himself, enjoy the luxury of&nbsp;having their boots custom-designed to&nbsp;fit their precise requirements. However, that in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way means it&nbsp;decreases their chances of&nbsp;getting injured or&nbsp;developing long-term medical issues.</p><p>Boot manufacturers often prioritize the player’s demands for agility and speed over injury prevention, a&nbsp;trade-off that the same podiatrist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledges</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;well-accepted among those playing at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high level.</p><p>And all this means that although Ronaldo’s feet might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;worrisome sight, they are actually a&nbsp;common reality within the world of&nbsp;professional soccer. And, even though there’s no&nbsp;way of&nbsp;us knowing whether or&nbsp;not the Portuguese <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>39-year-old</a> player does wake up&nbsp;in&nbsp;pain every day, we&nbsp;praise his dedication to&nbsp;the sport and the sacrifices he&nbsp;makes to&nbsp;keep overperforming.</p><p>It’s not just male athletes who spend most of&nbsp;their time to&nbsp;making sure their body is&nbsp;always in&nbsp;tip-top shape. There are plenty of&nbsp;women who are devoted to&nbsp;sports and fitness as&nbsp;well. A&nbsp;woman known as&nbsp;the «Shredded Kendall Jenner» is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. She’s a&nbsp;bodybuilder whose extremely muscular physique paired with her elegant looks have been stealing the internet’s attention.
