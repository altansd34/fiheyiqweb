This vocal powerhouse in disguise was <a href=#>Howie’s</a> Golden Buzzer on season 13 of the show. Her rendition of Otis Redding’s “Hard to Handle” sent her straight to the quarterfinals, and gained her a massive fanbase. Today, the singer seems to be starting fresh while continuing to work on her music.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-courtney-hadwin-on-agt>Courtney Hadwin on ‘AGT’</h2><p>This soul singing queen auditioned for America’s Got Talent at just 13 years old. This seemingly shy schoolgirl from Hartlepool, England,&nbsp;stepped onto the AGT stage where she delivered one one of the most surprising performances in the show’s history. Her singing and dancing was compared to that of the great Janis Joplin, and to that, I completely agree. Mandel described his season 13 Golden Buzzer as “not from this era,” as we all went on to watch her thrive in the live performances.</p><p>Hadwin’s <a href=#>audition video</a> amassed more than 50 million views on AGT’s YouTube Channel in its first five months. This was also the most viewed audition from season 13. She returned to perform live at the start of the quarter-finals. She sang “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” by James Brown, and earned a standing ovation from the judges.</p><p>At the semi-finals, Hadwin took the stage again and performed “Born to be Wild” by Steppenwolf. Her version of the song secured her a spot in the finals, where she sang Tina Turner’s “River Deep Mountain High.” Courtney Hadwin pulled out all the stops in the finale, singing “Could Have Been Me” with The Struts, as well as “Piece of My Heart,” by Janis Joplin. She unfortunately did not receive enough votes to advance to the top five, and was eliminated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CQY8tw3Frrg/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>MEET THE 36 ACTS PERFORMING DURING THE ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’ LIVE SHOWS</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-fresh-new-start>A Fresh New Start</h2><p>Courtney Hadwin’s career did not come to and end after her time on the AGT stage. In fact, it seems that her artistry is taking on a fresh new start. Hadwin has shared photos of herself in the studio rocking a Pink Floyd band tee. It seems that she has managed to stay true to her vintage 1970s aesthetic.</p><p>The gritty vocalist has also shared a TikTok with her fans. Here, she takes us behind the scenes of the first song she has written and produced. In the video, she teases “Playing With Fire,” her first original work. Hadwin’s Spotify profile only consists of covers at the moment, so it will be exciting to see some original content from the young star.</p><p>It looks like the only direction to go is up for the former AGT finalist. Her talent has already earned her a solid fan base of loyal supporters (Howie Mandel of course being one of them), who are excited to hear what is next in store for her.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BGT-dogs-e1633626197803.jpeg alt="The Cutest Dog Auditions in ‘Britain’s Got Talent’ History" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>courtney hadwin</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWZqHqis9NmnqiklJq7bq7Us7Geql2YvLa%2B06ecsmWYlrG4tc1mrKllpKR6r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
