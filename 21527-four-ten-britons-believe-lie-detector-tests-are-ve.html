New YouGov research reveals that four in ten Britons believe that lie detector tests are either “very” effective (4%) or “quite” effective (36%) at determining whether or not someone is lying.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Lie20detector201-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>By contrast, just over a third of people think such tests are “not very” effective (28%) or “not at all” effective (9%), with the remaining 23% saying they don’t know.</p><p>Those most likely to believe in the accuracy of polygraphs are Conservative and Leave voters, with 46% among both groups saying they believe the tests to be very or quite effective. By contrast, this figure is 36% among Labour voters, 34% among Remain voters and 21% among Lib Dem voters.</p><p>The youngest Britons (18-24 year olds) are the most likely to be sceptical of polygraph test results, with 49% believing them to be either “not very” or “not at all” effective.</p><h4><strong>Little support for allowing lie detector tests in UK courts</strong></h4><p>Whether or not the results of polygraph tests are admissible as evidence in court is decided by the individual states in the USA, but here in the UK – as well as in many other countries – there is a blanket ban on using them as lie detectors are not considered to be reliable enough.</p><p>That being the case, do Britons believe that results from lie detector tests should be admissible in court? Only a quarter (27%) do, including 73% of those who think they are polygraph tests are “very” effective and 49% of those who think they are “quite” effective.</p><p>By contrast, 43% say the results of such tests should not be admissible, including 72% of those who think they are “not very” effective and 87% of those who believe they are “not at all” effective. The remaining 30% are unsure.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Lie20detector202-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmaCc4OMn6auql2psq95waugraeeqHqjscuinK%2BdXaG2pnnDnquem6Skv27AxKyrrGWRp7JuwsQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
