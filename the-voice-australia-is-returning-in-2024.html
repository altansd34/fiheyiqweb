As a consequence of her victory, she took home $100,000 and a recording contract with Universal Music Australia. Interestingly, Stokes is the oldest winner of the show since its premiere in 2012.</p><p>“It feels amazing, going from The Blinds to being in the Grand Finale and somehow believing that I can do this. It’s just thanks to Rita for believing in me,” she said.</p><p>During the Finale, Stokes performed three impressive performances, including her fantastic rendition of “All By Myself” by Celine Dion. She also honored Tina Turner alongside her coach <a href=#>Rita Ora</a> by singing “Simply The Best.” Lastly, she belted out her winning single, “Nobody.”</p><p>“Tarryn is one of the best singers I have ever heard, not only in Australia but the world,” Ora said. “It is a dream seeing you flourish after everything you have sacrificed.”</p><p>Growing up in a musical family, Stokes has been drawn to music at a very young age. Additionally, ahead of her joining the competition, she had a connection to Sebastian and Jessica Mauboy. She worked on one of Sebastian’s albums and has served as Mauboy’s supporting act on tour. She effortlessly became a fan-favorite after her Blind Auditions after singing Sara Bareilles’ “She Used to be Mine.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_KatharineMcPhee_DavidFoster_Bruce-GlikasWireImage-220x147.jpg alt="Katharine McPhee, David Foster Don’t Want Son Rennie to Become an “A**hole”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice Australia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecCuqq2qkaG2onnIrGSrnaSqv6%2B1zaBkoqZdZ31zgI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
