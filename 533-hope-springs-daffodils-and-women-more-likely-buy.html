A survey commissioned by the International Flower Bulb Centre has found that 30% of UK adults are more likely to buy flowers during the spring time, far above any other season, including summer – when a comparatively small 17% buy flowers for the home. Only 12% buy flowers in winter but autumn fared the worst – only 2% regularly buy flowers in these colder months.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/YG_LifeStory_Daffodils.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=heading>A host of golden daffodils</p><p>When given a selection of flowers to choose from as gifts for friends or family, 39% opted for daffodils as opposed to only five percent apiece for hyacinths and irises, and a tiny two percent choosing amaryllis. Daffodils retained their traditional springtime popularity and are the favourite among older respondents, with 46% of those over 55 choosing this option compared to 32% of 25 to 34 year olds. Tulips appear to be the youthful choice as only 14% of over 55s picked this compared to just over one in five (21%) of 25 to 34 year olds.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the survey found that men are less likely to buy flowers regularly. Only 19% of UK males are buying bouquets at least once a month, as opposed to the 28% of women who do – nearly 10% more every month. 17% of men say they never buy flowers as presents compared to 12% of women.</p><p class=heading>Flowers as a gift?</p><p>When it comes to buying blooms, people are most likely to indulge others rather than themselves with a springtime gift - only 15% stated that they would never buy spring flowers for a gift. Nearly a quarter (24%), on the other hand, never buy flowers for the home, although again, men are worse culprits than women, with 30% stating that they never decorate their house with flowers as opposed to only 17% of women.</p><p class=heading>For full survey details and results, please <a href=#>click here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhtY2h6qbvPnmSsqKKeu6i%2FjJ2Yn56fmbatv4yapZ1lp6S6prqMpqarnV2htqyxy7Jkm62pYg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
