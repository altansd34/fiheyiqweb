Our beloved actress <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a> has blessed&nbsp;us throughout the years with amazing romances, so&nbsp;it’s only fair to&nbsp;her to&nbsp;love and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;loved deeply. Her story with her husband started off weirdly, but eventually became her fairy tale.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> believe that love can be&nbsp;found under any kind of&nbsp;circumstances&nbsp;— that’s why we’re happy to&nbsp;share the <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> of&nbsp;Kate Winslet and her husband.</p><p><h2>Kate has been married twice before.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f79/8b7/9e5b335fc3acfabe201e3c92c5.jpg><p>The <i>Titanic</i> star’s love life has not been easy. As&nbsp;someone who’s been very successful career-wise, her previous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriages</a> didn’t work out as&nbsp;she had hoped. Kate’s first <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> lasted only for 3&nbsp;years, and her second&nbsp;— for 8. She became a&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;Mia in&nbsp;2000 and Joe in&nbsp;2003.</p><p>Since we&nbsp;can never know what truly happens between married couples, Kate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> these words when she was asked about her <a href=# title=divorces data-link=tag>divorces</a>: “I&nbsp;know lots of&nbsp;people who are not in&nbsp;the public eye who have gone through several marriages, I&nbsp;really&nbsp;do. And it’s just those are the cards that life dealt&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;didn’t plan on&nbsp;it&nbsp;being that way. And it&nbsp;hasn’t been easy, you know.”</p><p><h2>One day, she faced a&nbsp;life-threatening situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06b/266/6b63245d35aa59a7eae7b45c6e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, our A-list star was vacationing along with her daughter Mia and son Joe on&nbsp;Necker Island, a&nbsp;luxury private island run by&nbsp;Virgin Limited Edition, belonging to&nbsp;billionaire Richard Branson. One day during their stay, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fire</a> broke out and consumed the property where they were staying.</p><p>Luckily, she was able to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;danger with her kids. She recalled what happened that day and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;bra and passports and my&nbsp;children.” But when she was escaping that dangerous situation, she made an&nbsp;encounter that would forever change her life.</p><p><h2>The 2&nbsp;immediately formed a&nbsp;connection and fell in&nbsp;love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d8/831/d46a0b5719b376835d342134fc.jpg><p>That day, Kate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> Ned Rocknroll, the property owner’s nephew, who was also staying on&nbsp;the island in&nbsp;an&nbsp;adjacent residence. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>, “He&nbsp;was the only dude to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;head torch and a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;shoes, everyone else left everything behind.” They ran into each other in&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange way, to&nbsp;say the least, but they have been together ever since.</p><p>His real name is&nbsp;Edward Abel Smith, and he&nbsp;goes by&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;Ned Rocknroll. He&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;change it&nbsp;because he&nbsp;believed his original name was “boring.” Kate enjoyed his company and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “he&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite an&nbsp;original personality.”</p><p><h2>They tied the knot in&nbsp;2012.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d2/6b0/fc0bc75f66b93f4b6afe1d04eb.jpg><p>Ned proposed to&nbsp;Kate during the summer of&nbsp;2012, and they tied the knot in&nbsp;New York in&nbsp;December that same year. It&nbsp;has been said by&nbsp;a&nbsp;close <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a> of&nbsp;theirs that the wedding took place in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ceremony, attended by&nbsp;her 2&nbsp;children and very few friends and <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p>Although we&nbsp;don’t have many details about the wedding, we&nbsp;are sure that it&nbsp;must’ve been as&nbsp;remarkable as&nbsp;their love story. The couple welcomed their son Bear in&nbsp;2013, who is&nbsp;now Kate’s third child.</p><p><h2>Ned is&nbsp;very supportive of&nbsp;his wife and family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88c/5fe/8e8108571dac852cc69b79fe50.jpg><p>Kate has shared many times how <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lucky</a> she feels being with her husband Ned. She often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>refers</a> to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;the “extraordinary life partner.” He&nbsp;supports her during her work and takes care of&nbsp;her and their little family. And we&nbsp;can understand why she called him a&nbsp;“superhot, superhuman, stay-at-home dad” during an&nbsp;interview when she was asked about him.</p><p>He&nbsp;even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> his surname back to&nbsp;Smith because he&nbsp;feels responsible for his child and would like to&nbsp;set an&nbsp;example. Kate has finally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> her soul mate. She skipped a&nbsp;disastrous situation the day of&nbsp;the fire, but won a&nbsp;loving and caring family: “I&nbsp;believe strangers can meet and their lives can change so&nbsp;much that they simply can’t go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;being the person they once were.”</p><p>Do&nbsp;you believe that finding love amidst potential chaos is&nbsp;possible?
