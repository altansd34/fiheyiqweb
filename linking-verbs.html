Linking verbs are an integral part of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English grammar</a> and it’s highly likely you know and use at least some of them already. Whether you’re <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning English</a> or you’re a native speaker who’s curious about your own language, linking verbs deserve your attention. Let’s learn the definition of a linking verb and see some examples of how they’re used in sentences.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-a-linking-verb?>What is a linking verb?</h2><p>A linking verb connects the subject of a sentence with more information about it. Linking verbs can be followed by nouns, pronouns or adjectives. There are three verbs that are always linking verbs: be, become and seem. But there are many more that can be linking verbs, depending on the context. Here’s a list of 19 of the most common linking verbs.&nbsp;</p><li>be&nbsp;</li><li>became&nbsp;</li><li>seem&nbsp;</li><li>stay&nbsp;</li><li>remain&nbsp;</li><li>grow&nbsp;</li><li>act&nbsp;</li><li>go</li><li>turn&nbsp;</li><li>prove&nbsp;</li><li>get&nbsp;</li><li>fall&nbsp;</li><li>feel&nbsp;</li><li>look&nbsp;</li><li>taste&nbsp;</li><li>sound&nbsp;</li><li>smell&nbsp;</li><li>appear&nbsp;</li><li>touch</li><p>Not all of these verbs are linking verbs all the time. To really understand them, you need to see some examples.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Be>Be</h2><p>The first example of a linking verb is <a href=#>be</a>. This is often the first verb you learn in English so from the moment you say, “I am happy”, you’re using a linking verb. All forms of be are linking verbs, from am to was, had been to might be.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I <strong>am</strong> happy.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Kate <strong>is</strong> a pilot.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Those chairs <strong>must be</strong> uncomfortable.</li></ul><ul><li>Helen <strong>will be</strong> angry when she sees this mess.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>My dog <strong>can be</strong> very protective.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In all of these sentences, be tells us more information about what the subject is. It is not an action verb because it doesn’t tell us what the subject is doing.</p><p>Let’s look at the first two examples a little more closely:&nbsp;</p><p>“I am happy.”</p><p>Happy is an <a href=#>adjective</a>, as you probably know, but in this sentence, it is called a predicate adjective because it follows a linking verb.</p><p>“Kate is a pilot.”&nbsp;</p><p>Pilot is a noun that tells us more information about what the subject, Kate, is, so it is a predicate noun.&nbsp;</p><p>If you see a noun after an action verb, for example, I walk home or I eat cookies, it is not a predicate noun. It’s just a plain old noun.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=State-of-being-verbs>State of being verbs</h2><p>There are many other verbs that tell us more information about what the subject is. Let’s take a look at some examples of these linking verbs in sentences.</p><ul><li>He <strong>became</strong> frustrated with the difficult math problem.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Chris <strong>seems</strong> nice.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>The children <strong>stayed</strong> quiet while they watched the movie.</li></ul><ul><li>Everyone <strong>remained</strong> calm while we evacuated the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Ben <strong>grew</strong> restless while he was waiting for the concert to start.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Alison <strong>has </strong>always <strong>acted</strong> tough but I know she’s quite sensitive really.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>You <strong>went</strong> green and I was sure you were going to throw up.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>The weather <strong>can turn</strong> cold very quickly here.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>The issue <strong>had proved</strong> too tricky to solve.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>I <strong>got</strong> so hungry that I had to order room service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>My kids <strong>will</strong> always <strong>fall</strong> asleep quickly after we’ve been to the beach.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Senses-verbs>Senses verbs</h2><p>Some other very common linking verbs are what we call the sense <a href=#>verbs</a>: feel, look, taste, sound, smell, touch and appear.</p><ul><li>This blanket<strong> feels</strong> very soft.</li></ul><ul><li>The room <strong>looks </strong>so welcoming!</li></ul><ul><li>The eggs <strong>tasted</strong> a bit off.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Your vacation <strong>sounds</strong> interesting.</li></ul><ul><li>These flowers <strong>smell</strong> lovely.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Maggie <strong>appears</strong> standoffish at first but she’s very warm when you get to know her.</li></ul><ul><li>His stories about his difficult childhood <strong>touched </strong>my heart.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Linking-verbs-vs.-action-verbs>Linking verbs vs. action verbs</h2><p>You can replace the states of being or senses verbs with a form of be and the meaning will stay the same or be very similar. This is how you know that you have a linking verb.</p><ul><li>The children <strong>were</strong> quiet while they watched the movie.</li></ul><ul><li>This blanket <strong>is</strong> very soft.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>These flowers <strong>are</strong> lovely (not exactly the same meaning as smell, but it’s unlikely you’d say that flowers that smelled like a wet dog were ‘lovely’).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As we said, many of these verbs can also be used as action verbs, for example:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Ruth tasted the stew.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>The plant grew 10 cm in a week.</li></ul><p>You can tell that taste and grow are not acting as linking verbs in these sentences because you can’t replace them with be. Ruth is the stew sounds like there’s a possible cannibal on the loose who cooked poor old Ruth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Using linking verbs</h2><p>It’s very likely you already use quite a lot of these verbs, but it’s useful to understand the <a href=#>grammar</a> more deeply so you <strong>can be</strong> sure you’re using them correctly in the future. It <strong>might seem</strong> complicated at first, but with a little practice, you’<strong>ll feel</strong> confident in your abilities.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
