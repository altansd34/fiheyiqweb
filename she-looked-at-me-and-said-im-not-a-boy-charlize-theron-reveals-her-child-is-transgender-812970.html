The star says, “Adoption is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very personal thing, I&nbsp;know people who don’t feel that they could raise another child as&nbsp;their own. But I&nbsp;never saw a&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;raising an&nbsp;adopted child versus my&nbsp;own biological child. This was always my&nbsp;first choice, even when&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>.”</p><p><h2>Charlize was caught off guard at&nbsp;first.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/265/14f/0fe23e553895249c8a98b00e9c.jpg><p>DRILA/Broadimage/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>DRILA/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>At&nbsp;first, the actress didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expect</a> that Jackson really wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl, “Yes, I&nbsp;thought she was a&nbsp;boy too. Until she looked at&nbsp;me&nbsp;when she was 3&nbsp;years old and said, ’I&nbsp;am not a&nbsp;boy!’ Both of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>them</a> get to&nbsp;find who they want to&nbsp;be, and it’s not for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;decide. My&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent is&nbsp;to&nbsp;love them and to&nbsp;make sure they have everything they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;what they want to&nbsp;be.”</p><p><h2>She fully accepts her daughter’s decision.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac2/cc1/094f2251fe96105b55f534ad8d.jpg><p>Theron highlighted the importance of&nbsp;using the appropriate pronouns when referring to&nbsp;her child and asked people to&nbsp;be&nbsp;respectful.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>, “My&nbsp;daughter’s story is&nbsp;her story, and one day, if&nbsp;she chooses, she’ll tell her story. I&nbsp;feel like it&nbsp;was important to&nbsp;let the world know that I’d appreciate it&nbsp;if&nbsp;they’d use the right pronouns for her. It&nbsp;became harder the older she got that people were still writing about her in&nbsp;the wrong pronouns. I&nbsp;was still talking about her in&nbsp;the press using the wrong pronoun. It&nbsp;really hurt her feelings. I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;that mom.”</p><p><h2>She’s a&nbsp;single mom of&nbsp;2&nbsp;proud daughters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/413/2e4/1e676356958cc9d4bab75d2c75.jpg><p>Theron is&nbsp;raising “2&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beautiful</a>, proud, black African girls” as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single parent. She revealed that she’s “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shockingly</a> single” after having been in&nbsp;relationships with Sean Penn and Stuart Townsend. However, Charlize later mentioned that she wasn’t desperate to&nbsp;date.</p><p><h2>The star supports the LGBTQIA+ community.</h2></p><p>Charlize is&nbsp;appreciated in&nbsp;the LGBTQIA+ community and has often shown <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>support</a> for gay men and lesbians throughout her professional life.
