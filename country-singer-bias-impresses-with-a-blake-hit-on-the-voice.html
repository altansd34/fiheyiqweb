During a Blind Audition, country singer BIAS sang the country crooner’s hit “God’s Country,” impressing coaches Gwen Stefani and Reba McEntire.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bias-wows-gwen-stefani-reba-mcentire-during-his-blind-audition>BIAS Wows Gwen Stefani, Reba McEntire During His Blind Audition</h2><p>During the October 3 episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a>, contestant BIAS belted out a rendition of the former judge’s iconic song. The move was extremely gutsy, but he successfully surpassed the challenge. After the opening notes played, all coaches immediately paid attention, especially the country singers.</p><p>BIAS added his own spin to the song, completing the performance with his energetic movements. In the end, he finished strong, attracting Stefani and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McEntire </a>to fight over him.</p><p>After the performance, self-proclaimed Shelton’s son, coach Niall Horan, expressed what he thought about the contestant’s audition. According to him, even Shelton himself will tell BIAS that “God’s Country” is a “very, very hard song to sing.”</p><p>“I remember when he first started singing it live, he would be like ‘Oh my god,’ because it takes so much air,” she said.</p><p>“Some of the pitch issues I was hearing were literally the reason why I didn’t turn. And also Blake would tell you, that’s a very, very hard song to sing. I mean you got the approval from the Queen of Country,” Horan said.</p><p>John Legend butted in: “And the Queen of Shelton.”</p><p>“You’re doin’ all right,” Horan said.</p><p>As per Legend’s views, he stated that he loved how “soulful” BIAS’ rendition was. He went on and stated that his cover was a cool and impressive take on Shelton’s hit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stefani-pulled-the-gwen-shelton-card>Stefani Pulled The “Gwen Shelton” Card</h2><p>During BIAS’ introduction, he admitted that his song choice was intended to attract the attention of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shelton’s wife</a>. As he successfully did, it was then Stefani’s turn to convince him to be on her team.</p><p>“I loved your energy, I loved your spirit, and at the end of the song, you had some really cool kind of texture and growl,” she said.</p><p>She further added that her name is “Gwen Shelton.” Stefani then held up her phone to stress her close connection to the country star.</p><p>“Just a phone call away,” she joked.</p><p>It was pretty obvious that BIAS would’ve chosen Twen Gwen, McEntire didn’t back out.</p><p>“When you started singing and then the crowd got into it, I knew you must have been doing something really good out here,” she said. “And I thought ‘Oh my gosh, I love the way he sings.’ That’s when I hit my button, and I was so glad I did because you were kicking some major butt out here.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Despite McEntire’s persuasive words, BIAS was convinced he must be on Stefani’s side.
