The story of former <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> semifinalist, <a href=# class=broken_link>Calysta Bevier,</a> will forever be remembered to fans of the hit NBC talent show. Performing Rachel Platten’s ‘Fight Song,’ Calysta not only wowed the audience, but she earned <a href=#>Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer</a>. Her performance moved the judges to tears once she shared her story of fighting a rare form of ovarian cancer.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When the judge America loves to hate awarded the then-16 year old his Golden Buzzer, audiences knew they were witnessing the rise of a superstar. Calysta’s Stage 3 cancer battle made the strength shown during her performance all the more touching.</p><p>With her impressive vocal control and beautiful voice, the Season 11 contestant advanced straight to the live rounds thanks to Cowell. First gaining the attention of talk show host <a href=#>Ellen Degenres</a> on Youtube, Calysta used her time on AGT to perform other motivational songs such as Christina Perri’s ‘Human’ and Sara Bareilles’s ‘Brave.’&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel like a lot of people take for granted what they have in their lives and they kind of just ride along and don’t really do much,” Calysta <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a 2016 interview</a>. “You can’t just sit around if you have something you want to do. You need to go for it because you don’t know how long you have.”</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-s-calysta-bevier-continues-to-make-new-music>‘AGT’s Calysta Bevier Continues to Make New Music</h2><p>Going for it is exactly what Calysta continues to do.
