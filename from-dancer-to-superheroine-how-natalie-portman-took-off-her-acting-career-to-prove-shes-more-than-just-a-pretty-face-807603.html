Although she started at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age, this <a href=# title=actress data-link=tag>actress</a> managed to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the film industry over time and had to&nbsp;undergo an&nbsp;important transition to&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;choose her roles. Not only that, but she also had to&nbsp;match her career with her university studies and fight to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recognized by&nbsp;academics as&nbsp;a&nbsp;great professional.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> took a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;her filmography to&nbsp;find the highlights of&nbsp;her career. We&nbsp;also looked into how her university studies helped her to&nbsp;delve deeper into each character she played over the years.</p><p><h2>Her beginnings as&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie star weren’t ideal.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef6/547/19e0cd524da183fbf1a1f83108.jpg><p>Natalie Portman made her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debut</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;film actress at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;eleven in&nbsp;the movie <i>Léon: The Professional</i>. She says it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very exciting experience: “It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;first time on&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie set and with incredible actors.”</p><p>Sometime later, she would be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>part</a> of&nbsp;<i>Beautiful Girl</i>’s cast. Both in&nbsp;this and in&nbsp;her first film, Portman appeared in&nbsp;scenes where she had to&nbsp;play very mature roles for her age. This affected her in&nbsp;some way to&nbsp;the point of&nbsp;questioning her own safety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b1/a0c/34115658c389318c5f39c74daf.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was very uncomfortable for the young actress to&nbsp;see how men were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attracted</a> to&nbsp;her, knowing that she was a&nbsp;minor. So&nbsp;she set boundaries and proved to&nbsp;herself she was a&nbsp;serious and prudent person. Recalling what she felt in&nbsp;her early days within the industry, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, “When I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager, I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;have any love scenes or&nbsp;wear makeup.”</p><p><h2>Her previous experience did not stop her from pursuing her dream of&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;actress.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/062/314/af707356688071bf83ce5b902f.png><p>Natalie was very clear in&nbsp;that she wanted to&nbsp;commit to&nbsp;acting, but she was also aware that certain roles could become uncomfortable for her. For example, when she was offered the role of&nbsp;Padme in&nbsp;the <i><a href=# title="Star Wars" data-link=tag>Star Wars</a></i> prequels in&nbsp;1999, she considered it&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>big commitment</a> because it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;whole saga in&nbsp;which, in&nbsp;addition, her image could be&nbsp;compromised.</p><p>Indeed, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>problem</a> was that she later had a&nbsp;hard time rebounding in&nbsp;her career because she was considered a&nbsp;bad actress: “I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the highest-grossing movie of&nbsp;the decade, and no&nbsp;director wanted to&nbsp;work with&nbsp;me”. Luckily, director Mike Nichols recommended her for the film <i>Cold Mountain</i>. This performance was better <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> by&nbsp;critics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24a/093/05aec758bf87b98ff91063e620.jpg><p>After that, she got a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role</a> in&nbsp;the movie <i>Closer</i> where she played an&nbsp;attractive girl as&nbsp;she had done in&nbsp;the past. The difference was that being an&nbsp;adult, she already had control over her image. She also had a&nbsp;better understanding of&nbsp;the commitments she was making. Still, she said about that role that “I&nbsp;have the body of&nbsp;a&nbsp;little girl”.</p><p>Years later, and with the idea of&nbsp;moving away from the child-adult image she showed during her early career, she began to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;other types of&nbsp;roles in&nbsp;more complex films, such as&nbsp;<i>Goya’s Ghosts</i>. She was also aware that to&nbsp;convince the audience, she had to&nbsp;know her character. In&nbsp;that film, she studied personality disorders in&nbsp;people who had been imprisoned for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p><h2>Natalie Portman proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;versatile actress, playing diverse roles in&nbsp;her films.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39b/1db/18abed5f9b9286f83029cc2bf6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2010, she starred in&nbsp;<i>Black Swan</i> and moved away from Hollywood’s “sweet girl” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>image</a>. She showed a&nbsp;different side of&nbsp;her, one capable of&nbsp;surpassing any expectations about her acting talent.</p><p>Then she went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;win an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Oscar data-link=tag>Oscar</a> for the role: “It&nbsp;certainly is&nbsp;stifling to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the one who’s enacting someone else’s idea of&nbsp;how a&nbsp;young woman should behave,” said the actress. “I’ve seen a&nbsp;real change [in&nbsp;the industry] since&nbsp;I was 20. But not a&nbsp;total change; you still see those roles of&nbsp;just being a&nbsp;dream girl or&nbsp;whatever some person wants you to&nbsp;enact”, she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20c/5b1/d1f68e538fab1945757ebd5bdb.jpg><p>She also surprised <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>people</a> in&nbsp;<i>V for Vendetta</i> by&nbsp;shaving her head in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;production, showing that she wasn’t afraid of&nbsp;how she looked to&nbsp;others and contrasting her character’s apparent fragility in&nbsp;an&nbsp;inhospitable place. However, she not only limited herself to&nbsp;her character, but also researched historical events <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>related</a> to&nbsp;the plot and even attended dialect classes to&nbsp;imitate the British accent perfectly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/570/88c/c631f351799d5149768a34e5b1.jpg><p>But she didn’t stop there. In&nbsp;2011, she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>part</a> of&nbsp;the cast of&nbsp;Marvel Cinematic Universe’s <i>Thor</i>. The actress was excited to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;scientist in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world of&nbsp;superheroes. Plus, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;film where CGI played a&nbsp;huge role, something with which she had already gained previous experience in&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>.</p><p>Years later, she moved away from pure fiction to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>star</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;biopic called <i>Jackie</i>, for which she also did prior research on&nbsp;her character. “The film gives you that sense of&nbsp;the mystery of&nbsp;a&nbsp;human being, because we&nbsp;can’t really understand anyone, and each person acts according to&nbsp;the different situations that arise at&nbsp;different times in&nbsp;their lives,” the actress stated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/065/793/eb38215d3e9307100391252246.png><p>Although Portman did not appear in&nbsp;the other Marvel films, she will <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>return</a> in&nbsp;2022 to&nbsp;<i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>, where she can be&nbsp;seen wearing an&nbsp;armor similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;the Asgardian hero. In&nbsp;the comic book, her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>character</a> becomes worthy of&nbsp;carrying the hammer. Thus, this film version could bring great surprises to&nbsp;all fans.</p><p><h2>She was able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;uni and work at&nbsp;the same time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40b/da3/0681c357319d71d62010e734ad.jpg><p>Natalie Portman gave <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>priority</a> to&nbsp;her academic studies. So&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that, during her time in&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>, she had to&nbsp;suspend acting for a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;college. She has a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;psychology, which, according to&nbsp;her professors, helped her to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>play</a> her role in&nbsp;<i>Black Swan</i>.</p><p>During her time at&nbsp;university, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>published</a> two scientific papers under the name Natalie Hershlag. One <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deals</a> with the production of&nbsp;hydrogen enzymes from sugar, and the other <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deals</a> with a&nbsp;study of&nbsp;the frontal lobe during object permanence.</p><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> if&nbsp;combining her education with filmmaking would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem, the actress replied, “I&nbsp;don’t care if&nbsp;college ruins my&nbsp;career. I’d rather be&nbsp;smart than be&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie star.” She also speaks several languages and, for a&nbsp;long time, considered leaving show business to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;clinical psychologist or&nbsp;veterinarian.</p><p>Natalie Portman managed to&nbsp;overcome her insecurities by&nbsp;revealing the objectification she went through during her early days as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress. Likewise, she lived her life quietly even as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, achieving her dream of&nbsp;finishing college and taking every character she played seriously to&nbsp;go&nbsp;beyond all expectations.</p><p>What were the films that you liked the most about Natalie Portman?
