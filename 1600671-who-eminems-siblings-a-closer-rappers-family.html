Speaking during a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><i>Rolling Stone</i> interview</a>, Eminem revealed how he tried gaining custody of his then 16-year-old half-brother when he was 20 years old.</p>I’ve seen my little brother bounce around a lot from foster home to foster home. My little brother was taken away by the state when he was eight, nine. But when he was taken away I always said if I ever get in a position to take him, I would take him. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f9fadf7770b88568.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who were Diddy's girlfriends?

He was so confused. I mean, I cried just goin’ to see him at the foster home. The day he was taken away I was the only one allowed to see him.<p class=align-left>Now, Nathan credits Eminem with being a positive influence in his life. During the 2023 <i><a id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjx7YEYyTU4&ab_channel=justalittleshadypodcast" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Just a Little Shady</a></i> podcast, he recognised his influence, crediting him as the ideal role model that shaped him into the father he is today.</p><p class=align-left>Like his brother Eminem, Nathan is also in the entertainment industry. He has released music under the name Nate Kane and dabbles as a DJ, music producer, and actor.</p><p class=align-left>Nathan has appeared in <i>Devil’s Night: Dawn of the Nain Rouge</i> (2020) and the music video for Swifty McVay's song <i>Scariest Thing</i>.
