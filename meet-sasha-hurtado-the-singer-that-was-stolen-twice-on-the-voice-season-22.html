Here’s everything to know about th 18-year-old singer, as she continues to fight in the Live Playoffs.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sasha Hurtado was Stolen in the Battles, Knockouts</h2><p>Sasha Hurtado hit all of the right notes during her Blind Audition of Bishop Briggs’s “River,” which led <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Camila Cabello</a> and John Legend to turn their chairs. The 18-year-old singer ended up choosing Cabello as her coach, securing a spot for the next round.</p><p>When The Voice Battles took place, Sasha was pitted against Devix. Together, they sang MGMT’s “Electric Feel.” Although she put on a good performance, she almost went home because Cabello decided to keep Devix on her team. Nevertheless, fate was on her side when Gwen Stefani pressed her Steal button.</p><p>In the Knockout Rounds, Sasha had to beat <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyssa Witrado</a> and Daysia to stay on Team Gwen. She impressed all judges with her larger-than-life vocals in her rendition of “Make It Rain” by Ed Sheeran. Even though Sasha once again impressed, she wasn’t lucky enough to earn the spot in the next round.</p><p>This would’ve been Sasha’s last day, but Legend refused to let her walk away. Consequently, he used his only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steal</a> and recruited Sasha on her team.</p><p>“She’s been so good throughout these rounds,” he said. “She’s been stolen twice now. And she just hit every note so beautifully and with some precision and control.”</p><p>Surely, Sasha’s journey in The Voice is a dynamic one. Being stolen twice, this surely means that she’s a force to be reckoned with.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-was-sasha-before-the-voice-season-22>Who Was Sasha Before The Voice Season 22?</h2><p>Born and raised in Dallas, Georgia, Sasha possesses multicultural origins with her Mexican father and Floridian mother. Consequently, having Hispanic roots drove her to love several music styles.</p><p>Sasha was a starting independent singer-songwriter before she joined The Voice. She sealed her first paid gig at 14 and since then, her vocal experience has been seasoned in multiple venues in Georgia.</p><p>Additionally, she finds inspiration in a number of music <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>genres</a> ranging from soul to pop. Through years, she was able to find her “own unique lane of artistic expression.”” She manifested this when she dropped two singles at 18, titled “First” and “Mr. No Good Guy.”</p><p>Will Sasha make it all the way into the finale? Only time will tell. Be sure to tune into The Voice on NBC on Mondays and Tuesdays to keep up to date with Sasha’s journey.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_KimCruse_Elizabeth-MorrisNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Team Legend’s Powerhouse Singer Kim Cruse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWjlsCprYyhrKuskZm8bsDHnmSsoZ6csrN506GYrWWnlsBuv9Ooo56mXanEqq%2FEZqanZaSdsm7CzqKanmWjmq60u81maWtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
