Fast forward to July 2023 — when rumors about a Swift-Kelce relationship first began circulating online — marked a clear breakthrough, catapulting that steady climb into rapid growth.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The NFL’s popularity among women has been growing —&nbsp;Swift bumped it up</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Between July and December of last year, the share of Gen Z and millennial women with favorable opinions of the NFL grew 11 percentage points from 53% to 64%. This demographic also exhibited notable growth among several other key brand metrics, including positive buzz and weekly usage.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The data makes it clear: Taylor Swift’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>legions of young female fans</a> tuning in to watch her support Travis Kelce is undoubtedly the X-factor that propelled the NFL’s popularity among women to new heights throughout the 2023 season. Her presence has driven <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>record</a> female viewership of regular season games, generated hundreds of millions of dollars in <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>brand value</a> for both the NFL and the Chiefs, and spawned a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>cottage industry</a> of Swift-Kelce merchandise.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Still, the league was outperforming many of its competitors among the female demographic long before the Swift-Kelce relationship was confirmed last September, suggesting Swift’s arrival on the scene was actually more of a “cherry on top” situation for NFL marketers — who in recent years have invested heavily in channels (like <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>TikTok</a>), interest areas (like <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>fashion</a> and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>beauty</a>) and online content (like <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>influencers</a>) that Morning Consult research shows are <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>especially popular</a> with young women. Even more tactically, the NFL continues to dedicate significant resources to growing women’s participation in flag football, an effort it called attention to via a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>90-second commercial</a> during Super Bowl LVII last year.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The NFL’s net favorability is now neck-and-neck with the MLB among women</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While all major leagues experienced a widespread dip on most measures during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the NFL has recaptured its existing support among women (and then some) at a quicker clip than its competitors. In December 2023, U.S. women’s net favorability rating of the league reached 37, a figure not seen since early 2017 — just before the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests began.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The NFL’s meaningful moving of the needle with women as of late offers lessons for men’s professional sports more broadly, which have long grappled with the question of how to effectively market to female audiences. (An issue that’s only intensified alongside the coming of age of Gen Zers, whose broad interest in live sports continues to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>lag behind</a> that of older generations.)&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Sure, the NFL is incredibly lucky that one of its players happened to earn the romantic attention of arguably the highest-profile star on the planet. But its sustained, unabashed effort to involve itself in typically female-leaning spaces should not be understated.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">2023 highlighted women’s willingness to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>spend big</a> on products and experiences that resonate with them, meaning the NFL would be wise to keep prominently featuring women and their interests at the highest levels of its game, and in all of the other worlds its game touches.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And considering the league just granted Kristin Juszczyk, designer of Taylor Swift’s viral gameday <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>puffer jacket</a> and wife of San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>licensing deal</a> to use NFL marks in her future designs — it appears to be doing just that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6y8rrHNZqWfpF2eu7Wx0Z6qrWViZX91</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
