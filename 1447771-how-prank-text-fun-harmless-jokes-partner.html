However, do not overdo it to avoid adverse outcomes.</p><h4>House intruder</h4><p class=align-left>You can text him that you feel a stranger's presence in your house or apartment, or you think someone has broken into your home.

Wait for his reaction.</p><h4>I haven't been honest with you</h4><p class=align-left>Send a simple message saying, "Babe, I have not been entirely honest with you." This message will make his mind think about wild things, and he is likely to respond within no time asking you to explain yourself.</p><h4>Our parents just quarrelled on the phone</h4><p class=align-left>If your parents have already met or know each other, prank him that they have argued on the phone and want to break you up. This message will make him scared for your relationship. Make sure you let him know it is a joke before he contacts or confronts his parents.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5pv8vn72rb3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top tips on how to woo a girl by texting</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ffe0cbd75bf36b7.jpg><h3>How to prank your crush over text</h3><p class=align-left>Trying to prank your crush over text is somewhat a risky thing to do because you do not want to chase them out of your life.</p><h4>Pretend to be someone else</h4><p class=align-left>Send messages to him as someone else, maybe as an old friend, relative, or classmate. To do this, you must have some background information, for example, the school he went to. Allow the conversation to progress to reasonable levels, then reveal your true identity.</p><h4>Crash his car prank</h4><p class=align-left>Text him that you accidentally hit his parked car. He will be furious and immediately rush he parked it last to see the extent of the damage.</p><h4>Transform yourself into a bot</h4><p class=align-left>This one requires dedication as it needs time to craft the messages. Come up with a text that resembles one made by a bot. If he has your number, he will wonder why you are sending him bot messages and reach out.</p><h4>Get lyrical</h4><p class=align-left>This prank has been doing rounds for a while now. Choose a song with short sentences or questions and send them one by one. If he knows the jam, he will figure out which one it is.</p><h4>Airdrop</h4><p class=align-left>The airdrop feature is only available on iPhone devices. You can use it to send your crush a random funny photo. Ensure that it is not inappropriate because you do not want them to block you. With the right image, it can be the perfect prank that will spark a conversation with your crush.</p><h4>Re-send them the same text over and over</h4><p class=align-left>This is not the most creative prank, but it will catch your crush's attention. Simply send the same phrase again and again with no explanation. It will annoy him, but it will make him talk to you to find out what is happening. You can then explain it was a weird connection.</p><p class=align-left>Learning how to prank him over text is a fun way of creating memories with your boyfriend. Harmless jokes will leave the two of you in stitches and are a great way of connecting. However, you should always be cautious to avoid undesirable repercussions.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>How to make it up to someone through text when you have drifted apart?</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Legit.ng</a> recently published an article on how to <a href=#>make it up</a> to someone via text after you have drifted apart.
