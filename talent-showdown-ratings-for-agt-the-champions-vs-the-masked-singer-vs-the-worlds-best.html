So, how did they fare?</strong></p><p><strong>America’s Got Talent: The Champions</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p>This week Champions received a 1.7 in the ratings, placing the NBC hit spin-off in second place for both its timeslot and the night behind the 1.9 for ABC’s The Bachelor. No other network primetime program on Monday night saw anything higher than a 1.1, so that was a pretty impressive number for the finale.</p><p>The show once again dominated in total viewership with a season high of 10.57 million viewers. The Champions finale was the most-watched program on Monday night by a landslide; the closest anything else came to touching it was CBS’s Bull in the 10 pm hour with 6.80 million viewers.</p><p>AGT: The Champions proved to be a rousing success for NBC, and the program’s parent show will surely prove to be a hit once again this summer. While Champions seemed like it was always intended to be a one-off deal, rumors of another season of the spin-off have begun circulating, but that may face the obstacle of the pool of viable acts thinning after this “go big or go home” season.</p><p><strong>The Masked Singer</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/agt-champions-finale.png><p>Once again, The Masked Singer won the Wednesday primetime ratings game for not only its timeslot but the night as a whole. It got a 2.7, the highest rating its reached since the season premiere. (The closest any other Wednesday show came to that this week was CBS’s Survivor premiere with a 1.6.)</p><p>Viewership was also at its highest since the premiere with an audience of 8.27. The only shows which beat Masked Singer in that respect this week were NBC’s Chicago trio.</p><p><strong>The World’s Best</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/agt-champions-finale.png><p>The World’s Best can’t seem to stay consistent in timing and length of episodes. This week’s episode was two hours and aired on Wednesday at 9/8 c for the first time. Not even having network favorite Survivor as a lead-in helped it escape its lowest rating yet of 0.6, putting in in fourth in the 9-10 pm hour which was won by the aforementioned Masked Singer.</p><p>Viewership was also down this week, dropping to 3.65 million. It’s pretty clear CBS has made several mishaps in scheduling and promoting this show. This is a freshman series with a mid-season start date, not a well-known and well-loved hit, so they really should have put more effort into that (beyond the Super Bowl Sunday premiere) if they wanted it to succeed.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/American-Idol-2019-Oscars-promo.jpeg alt="Watch Contestants From ‘American Idol’ 2019 Perform During The Oscars" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5705qjnqakYsCpu9adprCmXaeutbXNoKpmnp%2BneqKz02aroZ1dmLWiuc%2BipqerXavAbsDHnmSmmaOgsqV50qKloJ2iYsO0edOhnGavn6e5pb%2BMm5ysrF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
