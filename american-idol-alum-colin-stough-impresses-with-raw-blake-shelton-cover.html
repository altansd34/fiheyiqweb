The musician recorded his rendition on TikTok while wearing a Whiskey Creek cap and strumming his guitar. According to Stough, “I’m Sorry” is one of the most undervalued compositions by the country star.</p><p>“One of the most underrated songs out there ahaha wasn’t going to post Because it’s a little rough @blakeshelton #mississippi #music #sorry,” he wrote.</p><p>In the clip, Stough was obviously drawn into the song, thus reflecting on the vibe of his cover. It also didn’t take much time for his followers to appreciate such raw recording as several Instagram users expressed their awe in the comment section.</p><p>“That rasp in your voice is unbelievable! You have a very bright future ahead of you,” one person wrote.</p><p>Aside from making music covers, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> season 21 finalist has also been writing his own songs. Back in May, he teased fans with a song described to be “one we can drink to.” It’s nonetheless unclear if Stough has any plans of dropping the full version of the song.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-actively-been-pursuing-music-since-american-idol>He’s Actively Been Pursuing Music Since American Idol&nbsp;</h2><p>Since his journey on Idol, Stough has booked gigs within and outside of his hometown.
