Jen later furthered her education at Pennsylvania State University. While still studying, she was actively engaged in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chi Epsilon Pi</a> Honour club and society. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Meteorology from this institution in 1998.</p><p class=align-left>The lady has previously admitted that her dream career was piloting. Her dream of flying planes incited a curiosity in the weather. She grew fond of watching weather reports in the Weather Channel and would even set the alarm to remind her to watch all her favourite segments. She would later abandon the dream of flying planes for meteorology. Being a meteorologist and weather girl is a passion that she thoroughly enjoys now.</p><p class=align-left>Her interest in this field was further fueled by living in Pennsylvania, a state that has varying weather patterns. She witnessed extreme weather events such as Hurricane Gloria in 1994 and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Great Blizzard</a> of 1993. During her years of schooling, she woke up early to conduct a study of the weather. Often, this was followed by dialling up the nearby radio stations to make a weather prediction for the next 24 hours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2243cd325ccd053f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Belle Delphine’s biography: Age, net worth, legal issues, career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The interest in weather during her younger years earned her support and encouragement from her relatives and friends.
