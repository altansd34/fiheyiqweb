The musical guessing game series is ready to puzzle and entertain viewers for another season in 2024. Here’s everything we know about the upcoming third season.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-did-i-can-see-your-voice-originate>How Did I Can See Your Voice Originate?</h2><p>Originally envisioning the program to be a show that allows anyone to be the main character, producer and creator Lee Seon-young came up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Can See Your Voice</a> in 2012. She initially wanted a competition show that “includes good singers.”</p><p>Later, she added bad singers, lip syncing, and guessing game as elements of the series. Combining all her worthy ideas, Seon-young eventually came up with the “mystery music game show.”</p><p>The show’s original format consists of a group of “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery singers</a>” identified only by their occupation. After the lip sync, a guest artist would attempt to tell who the bad singers from the group are without ever hearing their vocals. To take a guess, they are assisted by clues and a celebrity panel to help them during multiple rounds. By the end of the game, the last remaining mystery singer is revealed by means of a duet between them and the guest artist. During that time, the guest artist will find out if the person they chose is a good singer or not.</p><p>I Can See Your Voice was established as a franchise in 2016, spawning 33 adaptations since then. As of writing, the guessing game show has already aired in 31 countries and territories. In the United States, the series premiered on Fox on September 2020. I Can See Your Voice has already premiered for two seasons on FOX, the second season had an average <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">viewership</a> of 0.37 in the 18-49 demographic range, with around 2.079 million viewers per episode.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-season-3-slated-to-premiere-midseason-2024>Season 3 Slated to Premiere Midseason 2024</h2><p>Dr. Ken Jeong will return to his hosting duties for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season three</a>. Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Bailon-Houghton also return with a rotating panel of celebrity detectives to help one contestant eliminate the bad singers and make the good singers stay. Apparently the contestant has to tell the difference “without ever hearing them sing a note.”</p><p>“With $100,000 on the line, the contestant will attempt to weed out the bad ‘Secret Voices’ from the good. In the end, the singer whom the contestant picks will reveal their true voice in a duet performance with a musical superstar, resulting in an amazing musical collaboration or a totally hilarious train wreck,” the official synopsis reads.</p><p>There will be all-new theme nights and new celebrity panelists entering the show from week to week. As of writing though, the show has not announced the identities of the same yet.</p><p>Season three will start airing on Wednesday, January 3 at 8 p.m. The show will then be followed by the series premiere of We Are Family hosted by Anthony Anderson.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_WillArnett_Tom-GriscomFOX-220x147.jpeg alt="Will Arnett is Perfect as The Host of ‘LEGO Masters’ — Here’s Why" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>i can see your voice</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ken jeong</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZZlisKK6jKycnmWppMKzedWooJydXaS7brLOsWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
