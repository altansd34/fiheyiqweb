Romelu Lukaku</h3><p class=align-left>The Belgian wants to leave Stamford Bridge with Napoli interested. He is on a massive wage of £325,000 per week, which the club are ready to get rid of. Even though Napoli are interested, the idea of a swap deal has been muted. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Team Talk</a>, the Italian’s first offer of €25 million was rejected as Chelsea wanted €40mil.</p><h3>2. Raheem Sterling</h3><p class=align-left>The England international is on the same wages as Lukaku. The club are ready to let go and supported manager Enzo Maresca's decision to leave him out of the squad to face Manchester City. A deal is difficult due to his wages, but the club hope to get it on and recoup a significant amount from the £47.5mil he cost two years ago.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b644f29141f9b6d3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Victor Osimhen's transfer: Chelsea directors Winstanley, Stewart asking questions</span></p></a><h3>3. Ben Chilwell</h3><p class=align-left>Maresca publicly told the vice-captain to find a new club as he cannot find a position for him. Chilwell is on £200,000 per week, a <a href=#>salary</a> the club deems too high for a player who has been unavailable for most of the last seasons due to injury. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mirror UK</a>, a fee in the region of £25mil will be enough for clubs interested.</p><h3>4. Kepa Arrizabalaga</h3><p class=align-left>The Spanish goalkeeper was the most expensive in the <a href=#>world</a> when he moved to Stamford Bridge in 2018. He failed to justify the price tag and spent last season on loan at Real Madrid. He is on £190,000 per week. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Athletic</a>, the Saudi club Al-Ittihad inquired about him in July, but a fee could not be agreed upon.</p><h3>5. Trevoh Chalobah</h3><p class=align-left>The academy star was left out of the travelling squad for the US pre-season tour and was told to find solutions regarding his <a href=#>future</a>. The Blues demand £25mil, which is a big fee considering that he is an academy star.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b25507b9dd9ba146.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Romelu Lukaku aims jibe at Chelsea using Raheem Sterling's situation</span></p></a><h2>Chelsea fans clamour for Osimhen</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> reported that <a href=#>Chelsea fans clamoured for Victor Osimhen</a> to be signed after watching only 67 minutes of Nicolas Jackson’s poor display in front of goal during their defeat to Manchester City.</p><p class=align-left>The club have been linked to Nigeria, but some fans raised concerns over his suitability to Maresca's style.
