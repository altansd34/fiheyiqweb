<span class=val><a href=./categories/celeb>Celeb</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>How Your Life Can Change If You Marry a Prince or Princess</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Glamorous weddings, sparkling crowns, and the honor of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the <a href=# title="royal family" data-link=tag>royal family</a>&nbsp;— these are the things that might make&nbsp;us dream of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marrying data-link=tag>marrying</a> a&nbsp;prince or&nbsp;princess. However, tying the knot with a&nbsp;royal means following certain rules, which can certainly test any relationship&nbsp;— especially one that is&nbsp;constantly in&nbsp;the public eye.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>,<strong> </strong>we&nbsp;grew curious to&nbsp;see what being a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;a&nbsp;royal family really looks like, outside of&nbsp;the glamour and pages in&nbsp;glossy magazines. And we&nbsp;found some unexpected turns in&nbsp;the lives of&nbsp;royal spouses, which may make you look at&nbsp;this fairy-tale life from a&nbsp;different angle.</p><p><h2>1. You will need to&nbsp;forget about the title of&nbsp;“Prince” or&nbsp;“Princess.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcf/dce/65d37356268cb21dc6ead16da9.jpg><p>Marrying into the royal family doesn’t mean that you’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;king, queen, or&nbsp;even princess. Queen Elizabeth’s husband, Prince Phillip, <a href=#>can’t</a> actually hold the title of&nbsp;king. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;not even a&nbsp;king consort, as&nbsp;such a&nbsp;title doesn’t exist, so&nbsp;he’s a&nbsp;prince consort. If&nbsp;<a href=# title="Prince William" data-link=tag>Prince William</a> does become king, his wife, Duchess Catherine, will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>queen consort</a>.</p><p>When Prince Harry walked down the aisle with Meghan, she too became a&nbsp;duchess. Both Meghan and Kate don’t have royal blood, so&nbsp;they can be&nbsp;addressed as&nbsp;“Princess” only in&nbsp;the <a href=#>presence</a> of&nbsp;their royal husbands. While not accompanied by&nbsp;their better halves, Meghan and Kate will always be&nbsp;<a href=#>called</a> “Duchess.”</p><p><h2>2. You may have to&nbsp;choose between a&nbsp;royal title and true love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21e/d15/40b5be568ca072d5498b4cdca9.jpg><p>The English monarchy is&nbsp;actually one of&nbsp;the most liberal among the royal families. In&nbsp;some countries, when a&nbsp;royal member marries a&nbsp;commoner, they must give up&nbsp;their crown at&nbsp;once. When Japanese Princess Mako <a href=#>marries</a> her college sweetheart, <strong>she’ll have to&nbsp;<a href=#>give up</a>&nbsp;her crown</strong>, royal status, and her place in&nbsp;the royal family. The Japanese law forces women to&nbsp;abandon their crown when they marry someone not belonging to&nbsp;the royals. Surprisingly, this rule doesn’t apply to&nbsp;men.</p><p><h2>3. Your children may not have royal status.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03c/458/0315295f13a4f516e4c1268107.jpg><p>Sofia Hellqvist was a&nbsp;model and reality&nbsp;TV star before she became Princess of&nbsp;Sweden when she married Prince Carl Phillip on&nbsp;June&nbsp;13, 2015. Their children, Prince Alexander and Prince Gabriel, don’t have royal status. Sofia’s father-in-law, <strong>the king, <a href=#>canceled</a> their status</strong> by&nbsp;issuing a&nbsp;special statement in&nbsp;October 2019. Sofia and Carl Philip, however, <a href=#>say</a> that their sons now will have more freedom of&nbsp;choice in&nbsp;their future lives.</p><p><h2>4. A&nbsp;new life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;royal will reveal your past.</h2></p><p>We’ve all probably done things in&nbsp;the past that we&nbsp;wouldn’t like to&nbsp;remember and are not proud&nbsp;of. When a&nbsp;regular person marries a&nbsp;royal, <strong>everything that ever happened in&nbsp;their past will get put in&nbsp;the spotlight.</strong> Back in&nbsp;her college days, the now-Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge, <a href=# title="Kate Middleton" data-link=tag>Kate Middleton</a>, wore a&nbsp;<a href=#>sheer dress</a> that was initially a&nbsp;skirt but was pulled up&nbsp;like a&nbsp;dress to&nbsp;walk the runway at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fashion show, and people are still mad about it&nbsp;to&nbsp;this day. This event has been recreated for the <a href=#>film</a>, William And Kate, with actress Camilla Luddington playing the duchess.</p><p><h2>5. Politics are not your privilege anymore.</h2></p><p>Before marrying a&nbsp;royal, you might be&nbsp;politically active. That all comes to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end after saying “I&nbsp;do” at&nbsp;the altar and becoming a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the British royal family.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, though Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;is allowed to&nbsp;vote, she must keep things as&nbsp;<a href=#>neutral</a> as&nbsp;she possibly can. If&nbsp;she voted for one candidate over another, she could unfairly influence people’s opinions.</p><p><h2>6. You will need to&nbsp;eat quickly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea6/44e/027f6756b1b86c6b72ea01cbaf.jpg><p>As&nbsp;common people, we&nbsp;may be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;eating as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;please whenever we&nbsp;want. But a&nbsp;meal with the British royal family will put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;that. If&nbsp;the queen is&nbsp;present, the meal <a href=#>starts and stops</a> with her. When she puts down her fork and spoon, <strong>everyone else is&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;as&nbsp;well.</strong> You will probably need to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;snack before dinner.</p><p><h2>7. You may need to&nbsp;show affection toward close friends and family only.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/956/bd9/e009ba5ca19b168ac5c795fbaa.jpg><p>It’s a&nbsp;rule that royals cannot be&nbsp;<a href=#>touched</a> by&nbsp;non-royals. But this rule gets broken all the time, especially when the British royal family meets celebrities, politicians, or&nbsp;other major figures. If&nbsp;you become a&nbsp;royal and don’t love being touched, you’ll just have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with it&nbsp;because being royal means you mustn’t make a&nbsp;fuss.</p><p>For some other monarchies, this rule is&nbsp;not that strict and this becomes more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;choice, which is&nbsp;the case for the <a href=#>Queen Rania</a> of&nbsp;Jordan, who <a href=#>doesn’t</a> avoid coming into contact with non-royals, as&nbsp;can be&nbsp;seen on&nbsp;her <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p><h2>8. You can kiss your professional ambitions goodbye.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/987/e62/a25e395ff9bb6a96793fcc2189.jpg><p>Your <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> dreams may not mean anything once you become a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the monarchy. One of&nbsp;the most famous royals to&nbsp;ditch her career was actress <a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a>, who eventually became the Princess of&nbsp;Monaco. After her marriage to&nbsp;Prince Rainer, <strong>Kelly <a href=#>never</a> took part in&nbsp;any movies.</strong> Seems like being a&nbsp;princess is&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-time job!</p><p><h2>9. Your marriage may only become possible after a&nbsp;family vote or&nbsp;special permission.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e38/131/bb3ca053e19aa6037a021484ab.jpg><p>If&nbsp;regular people want to&nbsp;get married, they can just go&nbsp;to&nbsp;their local city hall and sign the papers. However, <strong>it’s not that easy to&nbsp;get married in&nbsp;the royal family.</strong> In&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK, the queen must give her written <a href=#>permission</a> for members of&nbsp;her family to&nbsp;get married. This is&nbsp;done in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;protect the family from marriages that might “endanger the status of&nbsp;the royal house.”</p><p>When Queen Sonja of&nbsp;Norway dated then-Crown Prince Harald of&nbsp;Norway, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;tell his father, King Olav&nbsp;V, that he&nbsp;would <a href=#>never</a> marry anyone but her. This would put the throne in&nbsp;jeopardy as&nbsp;Harald was the sole heir. The permission for marriage was granted only after King Olaf consulted the government.</p><p><h2>10. You will not be&nbsp;called by&nbsp;a&nbsp;nickname anymore.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5a/a61/ca0f6d51d3a10437157abe0707.jpg><p>Though we&nbsp;probably all love to&nbsp;call Kate Middleton by&nbsp;her first name, <strong>she legally can only be&nbsp;referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;the <a href=#>Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge</a></strong> or&nbsp;“ma’am.” What’s more, is&nbsp;it’s even more appropriate to&nbsp;<a href=#>call</a> her “Her Royal Highness Princess William of&nbsp;Wales.” If&nbsp;you aren’t too keen on&nbsp;your formal name before marrying a&nbsp;royal, this might cause additional stress for you.</p><p><h2>11. Seafood will stay in&nbsp;the ocean and off your plate.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c7/c80/2367cf5921a4a1b8e8bb8118f7.jpg><p>The royals avoid eating <a href=#>seafood</a> when they can to&nbsp;prevent food poisoning or&nbsp;a&nbsp;possible allergic reaction, which may distract them from their important duties. Though this rule has been around for quite some time, Prince Charles sometimes <a href=#>violates</a>&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>12. You will need to&nbsp;follow strict rules when accepting gifts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c4/f10/9c69265ed0a0eef3fb2e6e1636.jpg><p>Being gracious is&nbsp;probably the main rule you must follow if&nbsp;you’re going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accepted into any royal family. When you’re given a&nbsp;gift, you must think of&nbsp;the motives of&nbsp;the giver and whether they might want anything from you in&nbsp;return. If&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;chance they do&nbsp;want something in&nbsp;return, you shouldn’t <a href=#>accept</a> the gift, but the royal must thoroughly <strong>evaluate the risks of&nbsp;causing offense</strong> by&nbsp;not accepting the gift. Also, you won’t be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;accept anything that is&nbsp;worth more than <a href=#>$150</a>&nbsp;if you are a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the British royal family.</p><p><h2>13. You’ll have to&nbsp;forget about playing Monopoly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b53/175/b56d435c61a31408e3825725b9.jpg><p>Proper royals don’t engage in&nbsp;activities such as&nbsp;playing Monopoly&nbsp;— especially not in&nbsp;the British royal family. In&nbsp;2008, Prince Andrew Duke of&nbsp;York had to&nbsp;<a href=#>decline</a> the game, which was gifted to&nbsp;him during a&nbsp;meeting, because it&nbsp;gets too “vicious.”</p><p><h2>14. You’ll have to&nbsp;stand and sit in&nbsp;order at&nbsp;all times.</h2></p><p>The royals have a&nbsp;super strict <a href=#>order</a> that dictates when they must stand, sit, and walk. Basically, you will <strong>need to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the order of&nbsp;ranking</strong>. The correct order is&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;and Phillip, Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, and finally, Harry and Meghan. They must always stand in&nbsp;this order, and no&nbsp;other way is&nbsp;ever allowed.</p><p><h2>15. You may need to&nbsp;smile in&nbsp;public, even if&nbsp;you feel awful.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/561/9a6/326ae856f598b07430f0f8e9fe.jpg><p>Publicity becomes your lifestyle not only when you perform your royal duties, but also when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;your health. When Princess Diana fainted at&nbsp;an&nbsp;expo in&nbsp;Canada, her then-husband, Charles, <a href=#>fumed</a> at&nbsp;her, saying, “She could have passed out quietly, somewhere else, behind the door.” Being a&nbsp;princess means having to&nbsp;<strong>be&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;public opinion</strong> and always acting accordingly.</p><p><h2>16. Your parents may not be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;attend your wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8d/af2/3465085a57bb689c64c56880b3.jpg><p>Queen Máxima of&nbsp;the Netherlands married Willem-Alexander, the then-Prince of&nbsp;Orange, in&nbsp;2002. Máxima’s parents were not present at&nbsp;the wedding; her <a href=#>father</a> was told he&nbsp;could not attend due to&nbsp;his role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cabinet minister during the National Reorganization Process in&nbsp;Argentina, and her mother chose not to&nbsp;attend without her husband.</p><p>What is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule royals follow that may make you think twice about marrying a&nbsp;prince or&nbsp;princess?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yypq6qXaG2p7GMnJinZZOdrq%2BzxGagn2WppMJuucCrqbJlkWK9s7XNnJxmp6JivbO1zZycrKtdbX1xgo9wZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
