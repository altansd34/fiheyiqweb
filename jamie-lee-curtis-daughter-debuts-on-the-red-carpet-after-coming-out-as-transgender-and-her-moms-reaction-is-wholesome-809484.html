Coming out means feeling vulnerable, and there’s a&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;facing a&nbsp;potential rejection. For parents whose children have decided to&nbsp;transition, this may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenging experience that requires very balanced emotions and wisdom. Actress and activist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> knows this for sure, and our article today shows her personal approach and relationship with her trans daughter Ruby.</p><p><h2>Jamie Lee has always been standing for representation and equality.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f3/f8b/212601525cb69e901c43963307.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c92/9ce/f97d135a87b2dae13244349ba2.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jamie Lee Curtis" data-link=tag>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and activist who has never been silent about the equality of&nbsp;all people. The woman is&nbsp;an&nbsp;avid fighter for a&nbsp;big change in&nbsp;society and for raising awareness for human rights.</p><p>She is&nbsp;particularly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>concerned</a> about the transphobia that she has witnessed in&nbsp;everyday life, and she opened up&nbsp;about her feelings in&nbsp;her interviews. She says, “So&nbsp;Jamie Lee Curtis is&nbsp;scared, and you should be&nbsp;too. And Jamie Lee Curtis has a&nbsp;voice, and she’s trying to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it. And you should too. <strong>And that’s how we&nbsp;change things.</strong> We&nbsp;think about them, we&nbsp;learn about them and then we&nbsp;use our voices to&nbsp;bring attention to&nbsp;them and fight against them.”</p><p><h2>The actress sets the example of&nbsp;her views in&nbsp;her own family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aca/28e/408b005e1e9089aa884dd86e1a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c88/4d3/c76f325243addee20c3e012905.jpg><p>Jamie Lee and her husband Christopher Guest have two adopted daughters, Annie, 35, and Ruby, who’s now 26. Her younger daughter Ruby has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>come out</a> as&nbsp;transgender in&nbsp;2020, and the day when she announced this to&nbsp;her parents will probably be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most memorable in&nbsp;the mind of&nbsp;her mom and herself. Ruby describes her feelings in&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, “It&nbsp;was scary&nbsp;— just the sheer fact of&nbsp;telling them something about me&nbsp;they didn’t know. It&nbsp;was intimidating&nbsp;— but&nbsp;I wasn’t worried. <strong>They had been so&nbsp;accepting of&nbsp;me&nbsp;my&nbsp;entire life.</strong>”</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;devoted mom, Jamie Lee wasn’t hesitant to&nbsp;accept every single choice and opinion of&nbsp;her daughter. She had to&nbsp;learn new things after her child came out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;transgender, and she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>describes</a> it&nbsp;candidly, saying, “It’s speaking a&nbsp;new language. It’s learning new terminology and words. I&nbsp;am new at&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;am not someone who is&nbsp;pretending to&nbsp;know much about&nbsp;it. And I’m going to&nbsp;blow&nbsp;it, I’m going to&nbsp;make mistakes. I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;avoid making big mistakes.”</p><p><h2>Appearing on&nbsp;the red carpet together with her daughter has become quite an&nbsp;event for Jamie Lee.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afb/a08/78b8ab5d2a9c2be92ad149dd03.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/700/89b/7df1e15d6a818a1bc54c7efd5b.jpg><p>The <i>Halloween</i> star is&nbsp;a&nbsp;really proud mom. She cherishes her daughter’s transitioning and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “I&nbsp;watched in&nbsp;wonder and pride as&nbsp;our son became our daughter Ruby.”</p><p>This year Ruby Guest made her red-carpet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debut</a> after coming out as&nbsp;transgender. She attended the <i>Halloween Ends</i> LA&nbsp;premiere together with her mom. The premiere was a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> event, and Ruby joined her sister to&nbsp;support their mom at&nbsp;the world premiere of&nbsp;the film.</p><p>All three women looked glamorous at&nbsp;the event as&nbsp;they each wore long evening gowns. Ruby was wearing a&nbsp;silver pleated dress with a&nbsp;black blazer and was seen together with her loving mom, going hand in&nbsp;hand. In&nbsp;her Instagram, Jamie Lee wrote a&nbsp;short but very emotional caption about her motherly feelings about this special day. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>captioned</a> their photo with a&nbsp;heartfelt message, “<strong>My&nbsp;family. Proudest mother. Loving support.</strong>”</p><p>Jamie Lee Curtis is&nbsp;proving to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;awesome mom and a&nbsp;genuinely good person. And in&nbsp;the movie industry, there are plenty of&nbsp;other folks who are pushing for change and inclusivity for <a href=#>transgender</a> people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLeiucieZKWdlWKwtr7ToqpmnJGqtKnAxKtknZ2SqsG0ec6nZK2glWK%2FprCMnJirqJWpeqKy056pZpuforavs4yorK1lkah6tb7Ap6qgnZ6ZsrN5wKebZqCVp3quu8ysZKudkZjBqrvNZqCsZaedvK2x0qiknmVoZYZ1hJNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
