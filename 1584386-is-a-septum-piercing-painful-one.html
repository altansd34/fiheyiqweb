A piece of jewellery, such as a barbell or ring, is inserted into the piercing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9aacd730b698495b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Black crow's meaning: what does this bird represent?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Historically, this form of body modification symbolized rebellion and nonconformity and challenged societal norms. Septum piercings have, however, gained popularity in art and fashion, and different jewellery styles are now available for personalization. Thus, most people use septum piercings as a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1218053-latest-african-fashion-dresses-ladies.html href=#>fashion statement</a> or a way to express themselves.</p><h3 id=1584386-can-anyone-get-a-septum-piercing class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Can anyone get a septum piercing?</h3><p class=align-left>Pretty much. However, not everyone's septum has that thin strip of tissue in front of the cartilage (called columella). Ideally, piercers target this flesh for piercing because it is the sweet spot for this kind of aesthetic enhancement.</p><p class=align-left>If this tissue is thin or completely absent, piercing through cartilage is still possible but is more painful and slower to heal.</p><h3 id=1584386-why-do-people-get-their-septum-pierced class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Why do people get their septum pierced?</h3><p class=align-left>Most people get their septum pierced for various reasons.

In some cultures, a septum piercing signifies a rite of passage. It has also been traditionally associated with rebellion, individuality, or counterculture.</p><p class=align-left>The meaning can be subjective depending on who you ask. However, it is a departure from traditional beauty standards, a trend in the evolving cultural landscape for many women. For others, a septum piercing represents strength and resilience.</p><h3 id=1584386-is-a-septum-piercing-very-painful class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Is a septum piercing very painful?</h3><p class=align-left>All nose piercings are painful, and septum piercings are no exception. The undesirable fact is that you're piercing through cartilage, which is more sensitive than regular skin. However, their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pain scale ranks lower</a> than other body piercings.</p><p class=align-left>Contrary to popular belief, septum piercings are among the least painful. When performed accurately by an experienced professional, the piercing targets a soft area of thin skin, often called "the sweet spot." Avoiding nasal cartilage results in minimal pain. Some individuals experience a single tear, a normal reaction rather than intense pain.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c94f40b854d9e99.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest George styles: blouses and gowns for traditional marriage</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But how much does it hurt? If the piercer accurately targets the sweet spot, the sensation is often described as strange rather than painful and is akin to the urge to sneeze. Some people find inserting the needle uncomfortable.</p><p class=align-left>The consensus among artists is that <a href=#>staying relaxed</a> during the procedure can minimize pain. However, the level of discomfort varies from person to person and is influenced by factors like the expertise of the piercer and the application of numbing agents.</p><h3 id=1584386-how-a-septum-piercing-is-done class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How a septum piercing is done</h3><p class=align-left>The first step is to select a reputable piercer. Once your appointment is ready, the standard protocol is to provide your ID and complete paperwork, which includes signing a waiver. You will then sit on a chair to allow the piercer to disinfect the nostril area. The protocols may vary depending on the artist, but, as standard, they utilize:</p><ul><li>A needle (called the freehand)</li><li>Forceps to hold the nostrils open</li><li>A receiving tube to enhance symmetry</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6632969e4bc22ecb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is coconut: a fruit, a nut, a seed, a vegetable, or a legume?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Your jewellery is then slipped into the piercing as the freehand needle is pulled out. The actual piercing process is pretty <a href=#>swift</a> and typically takes a minute or two from start to finish. Regardless of the technique, the piercer observes strict sanitary and safety measures that include:</p><ul><li>The use of disposable sanitary gloves.</li><li>Disinfection of the nostrils.</li><li>The use of sterile needles and equipment.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9677186df61c5fc5.png><h3 id=1584386-ideal-septum-piercing-healing-time class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Ideal septum piercing healing time</h3><p class=align-left>The septum is a delicate part of the nose that often takes time to heal when pierced. Experts recommend that you refrain from interfering with the healing process. Changing the jewellery prematurely, for instance, can irritate and prolong healing time.</p><p class=align-left>Typically, septum piercings heal fully in 4 to 6 months. However, substantial healing can be achieved <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">between 2 to 3 months</a>, provided that septum piercing aftercare guidelines are followed. How quickly and how well one heals will hinge on factors such as:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/22b44c8ce6fbdeaf.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75+ small women's unique hand tattoos to enhance your look</span></p></a><ul><li>Stress levels</li><li>Immunity</li><li>Adherence to aftercare regimes</li><li>How little or how much you touch the piercing during the healing process.</li></ul><h3 id=1584386-how-risky-is-a-septum-piercing class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How risky is a septum piercing?</h3><p class=align-left>A septum piercing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">carries several risks</a>, primarily associated with allergies, infections, and improper healing. However, going to a skilled and reputable piercer can significantly reduce any potential risks. Cartilage damage can occur in rare cases, but the most common risks to consider include:</p><ul><li><strong>Infections: </strong>Piercing your skin can induce bacteria into the body and lead to infections. This can cause swelling, redness, pain, and discharge.</li><li><strong>Bloodborne diseases:</strong> Using unsterilized equipment can cause bloodborne diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis. So, emphasize the need for a fresh, sterile needle.</li><li><strong>Scarring and tearing: </strong>The piercing procedure can cause scars, which can be painful.
