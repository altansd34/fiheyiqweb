Though her pregnancy and little Sebastian were <a href=# title=healthy data-link=tag>healthy</a>, Rodriguez’s large belly drew a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;hurtful comments, ranging from “<strong>You look like you’re having twins”</strong> to&nbsp;“You must be&nbsp;in&nbsp;so&nbsp;much pain.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ad/f82/f3402751af9c914cd2fb9e13f3.jpg><p>While a&nbsp;big pregnancy bump can signal specific health problems, in&nbsp;other cases, it’s perfectly natural and just how a&nbsp;woman’s body grows. Rodriguez saysthat she and her baby were and are totally fine. Her doctor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reassured</a> her that it&nbsp;was nothing to&nbsp;worry about and that her <strong>petite build and short torso</strong> might have something to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac0/370/51587d5ac98e3655de3f915e02.jpg><p>Rodriguez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>emphasizes</a> that both of&nbsp;her babies were big while pregnant, so&nbsp;she wasn’t surprised: “<strong>My&nbsp;first pregnancy was exactly the same!</strong>”<strong> </strong>But she confesses that compared to&nbsp;her first pregnancy with her now 3-year-old daughter Sofia, this one was a&nbsp;bit more challenging because she<strong> </strong>had to&nbsp;fight <a href=# title=anemia data-link=tag>anemia</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07c/6e4/0f4c7752608900ad3b7b4a16b1.jpg><p>What came as&nbsp;an&nbsp;unpleasant surprise, however, were rude <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comments</a> from some people. Rodriguez said it&nbsp;was easy to&nbsp;ignore mean comments from<strong> strangers on&nbsp;the Internet</strong>, but people were also often rude in&nbsp;real life. She was even told that she looked “<strong>gross</strong>.” Some suggest she ’’check if&nbsp;there’s another baby inside,’’ while others pointed out how ’’<strong>huge</strong>’’ she was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a98/036/11903451f98e16f44354e6eed9.jpg><p>What shocked her the most was the fact that a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;insensitive comments came from women. But Rodriguez managed to&nbsp;remain unfazed, and she never responded rudely. She’d usually just say things like, ’’<strong>Yes, I&nbsp;am huge, and it’s hard</strong>.’’ Her Instagram <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post,</a> where she shared these insults with a&nbsp;smile on&nbsp;her face, took the Internet by&nbsp;storm, and her story resonated with many other women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a2/0e5/a1e09f5e81af9bd393c1741a7a.jpg><p>Despite all the negativity, this young mother has chosen kindness. She says that people shouldn’t be&nbsp;quick to&nbsp;judge and ought to&nbsp;show more love and compassion for pregnant women. “<strong>It’s already hard to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through so&nbsp;many physical changes</strong> that you literally cannot control&nbsp;— not to&nbsp;mention emotional changes too,” Rodriguez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/995/94a/6f05e7579e95752c11056118d6.jpg><p>“Regardless if&nbsp;a&nbsp;person is&nbsp;pregnant or&nbsp;not, I’ve always said if&nbsp;you have nothing nice to&nbsp;say, it’s best not to&nbsp;say anything. This is&nbsp;why&nbsp;I love <strong>empowering and uplifting others</strong> because there’s already enough hate and negativity everywhere,” Rodriguez added. Sebastian, who was born on&nbsp;June&nbsp;11, weighed 8.3&nbsp;lb and was 20.5 inches long at&nbsp;birth. His proud parents and older sister welcomed him.</p><p>How did your pregnancy&nbsp;go?
