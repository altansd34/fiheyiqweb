Such is a sad news for fans who had been expecting him to appear on the show once more.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-louis-van-amstel-is-not-coming-back-for-dancing-with-the-stars-season-32>Louis Van Amstel is Not Coming Back for Dancing With The Stars Season 32</h2><p>Since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> has not released its final cast yet, fans have been guessing the dancing pros who might be staging a comeback. Apparently though, season 32 will be an Van Amstel-free show. The dancer confirmed the news via social media.</p><p>“Are you going to be on Dancing with the Stars this fall ? You’re my favourite dancer!” someone asked him on Instagram.</p><p>“Thank you for saying that. I am not doing this coming season. Hopefully again in 2024,” he replied.</p><p>Upon seeing his response, fans were quick to express their disappointment.</p><p>“That’s a real bummer. It was great to have him back last season,” one fan wrote. “So I’m assuming this means that our list of male pros will remain the same. I wonder if we will get any more opt outs soon??”</p><p>“I’d hope he’d be considered for 2024 but yeah I’m super bummed about it, it was lovely to see him back, and I also have to say, I think his Technique was one of the strongest overall out of the pros,” another fan wrote.</p><p>For those who may not know, Van Amstel was one of the original pros who graced the first season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a>. Over the years, he’s competed intermittently on the show. However, despite being one of the favorite pros, he has never snatched a Mirrorball Trophy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-ballas-lindsay-arnold-witney-carson-announce-absence>Mark Ballas, Lindsay Arnold, Witney Carson Announce Absence</h2><p>Apart from Van Amstel, a number of DWTS pros have also announced their absence for season 32. Longtime pro Mark Ballas, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay Arnold</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Witney Carson</a> have already informed their fans that they will not be coming back for season 32.</p><p>Arnold and Carson have publicly revealed the choice not to join the upcoming season due to their families. Both of these female pros have given birth in 2023, and it’s not surprising that they would want to be hands-on with their kids at this time. Nevertheless, the two cleared up that they don’t see themselves retiring anytime soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ballas has announced his decision to exit from the show. In March 2023, the season 31 winner shared the news during DWTS live tour.</p><p>“I just want to finish this by saying that this will be the last time you see me dance in this capacity. I’m coming to a close tonight. This is gonna be my last dance. I had the best time ever this season, and this freestyle was a great way to finish it off. … Thank you guys for a lifetime of memories,” he said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_HannahBrown_AdamWoolard_Santiago-FelipeGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Former ‘DWTS’ Celebrity Contestant Hannah Brown Announces Her Engagement" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuuM6uoKxlppa7bq3MrKuepF2jvLV50Z6rrqqenruoecWoqWarlZbAsLqMbGlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
