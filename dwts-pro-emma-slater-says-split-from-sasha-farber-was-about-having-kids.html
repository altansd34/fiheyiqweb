According to Slater, their decision to separate was “about kids.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emma-slater-says-sasha-farber-split-is-about-kids>Emma Slater Says Sasha Farber Split Is ‘About Kids’</h2><p>News of <a href=#>Slater and Farber’s split</a> broke last summer. Earlier this year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Slater filed for divorce</a> from Farber after nearly five years of marriage. She recently appeared on Nick Viall’s Viall Files podcast, where she opened up about the reason for their split.</p><p>“It’s really the kid thing,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Slater said</a>, according to Us Weekly. “It’s interesting because I do want to have kids, I just don’t want to delay Sasha’s path in having kids because I know that he is ready for that. I don’t want to talk about him too much because that’s really for him to say, but it’s about kids.”</p><p>She said the issue had “nothing to do with” Farber, adding, “He’s always been very much himself. It’s me that’s found it difficult to understand why I’m feeling different.”</p><p>Slater and Farber both joined DWTS as a pro dancers in Season 17. Slater went on to win Season 24 with celebrity partner Rashad Jennings, while Farber has yet to win the Mirrorball. Last season, they were paired with Trevor Donovan and Selma Blair.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EMMA SLATER, SASHA FARBER REUNITE AT DISNEY WORLD AFTER FILING FOR DIVORCE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-slater-says-they-re-still-like-family>Slater Says They’re ‘Still Like Family’</h3><p>Slater had nothing but good things to say about Farber, emphasizing that they’re “still like family” and adding that “it isn’t really like the love is not there.” She explained that she and Farber are simply in “two different places.”</p><p>The dancer also shared that it’s “so hard” to have a relationship in the public eye, saying she wants to prioritize privacy in future relationships. When asked about her love life, Slater joked that “there is none.”</p><p>“I have visions of a guy walking into my life,” Slater shared. “I see like a tall guy with, like, blue eyes and, maybe, British or someone. Like, that would be ideal. I don’t know why that’s coming to my head. [And] blonde. I don’t know a guy like that.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_BlakeShelton_Michael-HickeyGetty-Images.jpg alt="Blake Shelton, Carrie Underwood Among Nominees for People’s Choice Country Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuscymmGarnJbBpr6MrJiyq12ova2102adq6edYsCiv8eaZJ%2BZopeys3nWmqpmmZKkwrV5x5qtoqaXYriqsNJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
