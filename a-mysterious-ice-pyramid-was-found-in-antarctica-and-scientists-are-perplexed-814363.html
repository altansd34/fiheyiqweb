However, it&nbsp;seems a&nbsp;pyramid has been found there with curious metrics. And that’s not all&nbsp;— let’s take a&nbsp;look.</p><p><h2>Scientists have discovered a&nbsp;mountain-like structure beneath the ice in&nbsp;Antarctica, resembling a&nbsp;pyramid.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a81/64c/c3fb2759f287d69bf7de4fbbaf.jpg><p>People have been intrigued by&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovery</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive pyramid-shaped mass in&nbsp;satellite images captured over the southern part of&nbsp;Antarctica’s Ellsworth Mountain range. Despite their charm, penguins are not known for being skilled architects, so&nbsp;the origin of&nbsp;this intriguing structure remains a&nbsp;mystery.</p><p></p><p><h2>The world’s largest opal matrix</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd6/96d/e26f13502d83522eeaad520dd4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, a&nbsp;remarkable discovery was made in&nbsp;the opal fields of&nbsp;South <a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>&nbsp;— the world’s largest opal matrix. This extraordinary stone weighed an&nbsp;impressive 25&nbsp;pounds (approximately 55,000&nbsp;carats) and was composed entirely of&nbsp;pure opal. Noted designer Stuart Hughes and his associates were the lucky ones who unearthed this precious gem.</p><p>With its immense size and rare beauty, the opal matrix was appraised at&nbsp;an&nbsp;astonishing $1&nbsp;million, showcasing its exceptional value in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;gemstones.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;Staffordshire hoard in&nbsp;the backyard</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/964/457/64a9365a7ab4a613d8a2904da4.jpg><p>On&nbsp;July&nbsp;5, 2009, Terry Herbert, an&nbsp;English farmer, was walking with his old metal detector near his house, searching for a&nbsp;ring that his daughter had lost. But he&nbsp;found <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>treasure</a> instead! 1,500 golden and silver items dating from the 7th century. The findings weighed 16&nbsp;lb (7.5&nbsp;kg), and its value was more than $5&nbsp;million.</p><p>As&nbsp;this hoard belongs to&nbsp;the country, the man only got a&nbsp;reward equal to&nbsp;half of&nbsp;the cost of&nbsp;the treasure....but we’re sure the farmer was more than happy with this!</p><p><h2>Treasures in&nbsp;an&nbsp;old chair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ea/c4b/b47c93564ea35e5d388838b437.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;fascinating tale from Biggar, <a href=# title=Scotland data-link=tag>Scotland</a>, a&nbsp;couple purchased an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>old chair</a> for a&nbsp;mere&nbsp;£5, but they left it&nbsp;untouched in&nbsp;their attic for several years due to&nbsp;financial constraints.</p><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t until six years later that Mr. Milner-Brown finally decided to&nbsp;repair the chair. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;removed the upholstery, he&nbsp;made an&nbsp;astonishing discovery&nbsp;— hidden inside were valuable diamond jewelry pieces.</p><p>Choosing to&nbsp;keep his find a&nbsp;secret, Mr. Milner-Brown surprised his wife with the precious stones, presenting her with a&nbsp;beautiful ring and a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;earrings.</p><p>Only in&nbsp;2016 did he&nbsp;finally reveal the hidden treasure to&nbsp;his wife, and together they sought the expertise of&nbsp;professionals to&nbsp;assess the true value of&nbsp;their findings. To&nbsp;their delight, the jewelry was appraised at&nbsp;an&nbsp;impressive sum of&nbsp;nearly £5,000, turning their seemingly ordinary purchase into a&nbsp;remarkable stroke of&nbsp;luck.</p><p><h2>Money found in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attic</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c73/2f5/a8a180531bb64d48354cad66f4.jpeg><p>One day in&nbsp;Utah, while Josh Ferrin was working in&nbsp;his workshop, he&nbsp;made an&nbsp;unexpected discovery. A&nbsp;carpet caught his attention as&nbsp;it&nbsp;peeked out from the ceiling. Curiosity got the better of&nbsp;him, and he&nbsp;tugged at&nbsp;the carpet, revealing an&nbsp;access panel to&nbsp;the attic. His intrigue led him to&nbsp;open the panel, where he&nbsp;stumbled upon a&nbsp;metal container. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;cautiously opened&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;was astounded to&nbsp;find several rolls of&nbsp;<a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a> neatly tied with twine.</p><p>To&nbsp;his amazement, this was just the beginning. As&nbsp;Josh explored further, he&nbsp;discovered not just one but seven boxes overflowing with money. Adding to&nbsp;the incredible find, he&nbsp;also came across two large black trash bags filled with cash. The total sum <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>amounted</a> to&nbsp;around $45,000.</p><p>Despite the substantial fortune before him, Josh felt the right thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was find the rightful owners. He&nbsp;took it&nbsp;upon himself to&nbsp;track them down and reached out to&nbsp;the house’s previous occupants. The previous owners were taken aback and shocked by&nbsp;the news.</p><p>Upon connecting with Josh, they revealed that they had recently inherited the house and believed their father must have hidden the money. Josh’s honest and honorable return of&nbsp;the money brought unexpected joy and relief to&nbsp;the family, who were grateful to&nbsp;reclaim their father’s hidden treasure.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;piano’s hoard</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/175/a46/50d24c5810baa5ee6c56727e54.jpg><p>61-year-old Martin Backhouse was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>invited</a> to&nbsp;Bishop’s Castle Community College to&nbsp;tune a&nbsp;piano that the Hemmings family gave to&nbsp;the college.</p><p>During his work, the man found 7&nbsp;bags with coins from Victoria’s reign under the piano keys. Experts estimated their value at&nbsp;$640,000.</p><p>It’s unclear who decided to&nbsp;hide the coins and when. Martin got a&nbsp;reward, but, unfortunately, the family that had owned the piano for 33&nbsp;years didn’t know about the money and missed their chance to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;reward.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;golden house</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/438/47a/8e18615eb79a155ec6a52d4230.jpg><p>A&nbsp;French man inherited a&nbsp;house in&nbsp;Normandy and found hidden gold coins in&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair, more in&nbsp;a&nbsp;whiskey box, and a&nbsp;huge pile of&nbsp;gold bars. The total value was almost <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$3.7&nbsp;million</a>, but he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;pay&nbsp;45% as&nbsp;inheritance tax.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;gold nugget weighing 11.5&nbsp;lb (5.5&nbsp;kg)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8a9/81b/784e20549797dcccc1c3919945.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Ballarat, Australia, an&nbsp;amateur gold digger strolled along the beach when he&nbsp;stumbled upon a&nbsp;peculiar object buried in&nbsp;the sand. Initially mistaking it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;car scrap, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;investigate further, and to&nbsp;his astonishment, he&nbsp;discovered it&nbsp;was pure gold. With each passing moment, the golden find grew as&nbsp;he&nbsp;continued digging.</p><p>Excited by&nbsp;his extraordinary discovery, the fortunate gold digger took the metal piece to&nbsp;appraisers, who confirmed its weight to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;impressive 11.5 pounds (5.5&nbsp;kilograms). This nugget turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the largest ever found in&nbsp;that region.</p><p>Its value exceeded $300,000, a&nbsp;substantial sum that more than covered the expenses of&nbsp;his metal detector and other equipment.
