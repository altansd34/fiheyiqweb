The first step, of&nbsp;course, would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove the old one, right? As&nbsp;you’re stripping off the old flooring, you start to&nbsp;see some weird colors and designs underneath the carpet. Wait a&nbsp;minute... Is&nbsp;that a&nbsp;life-sized monopoly board?!</p><p>What I’ve just described here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;San Francisco resident who decided to&nbsp;redo the carpeting in&nbsp;his first-floor bedroom. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;discovered the giant Monopoly board perfectly preserved on&nbsp;the floorboards, he&nbsp;obviously wanted to&nbsp;create giant life-size game board pieces as&nbsp;well. His wife wasn’t as&nbsp;excited about the idea, though, and they eventually went with a&nbsp;look that was a&nbsp;bit more classic. Oh, well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/61d/f71/3e889c58a89c345a6e43f170b8.png><p>Then there’s the story of&nbsp;two Sacramento homeowners that decided they needed to&nbsp;change their heating system. Inside the ducts and some walls, they were amazed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;dozen food jars. But I&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;telling you this story if&nbsp;those jars were empty, right? Inside those jars, they were surprised to&nbsp;find pure gold dust! Talk about a&nbsp;hidden treasure! This amazing find was apparently worth somewhere around $300,000.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;1995, some people working in&nbsp;Chatham Historic Dockyard of&nbsp;southeast England made a&nbsp;surprising discovery under the floorboards of&nbsp;a&nbsp;building. Down there were some 200 timbers that belonged to&nbsp;a&nbsp;mysterious and obviously very old ship. It&nbsp;took many years of&nbsp;research for them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;identify the ship.</p><p>In&nbsp;2012, however, they eventually concluded that the timbers belonged to&nbsp;the HMS Namur, a&nbsp;ship launched in&nbsp;1756 by&nbsp;the Royal Navy. When checking history records, they discovered that Namur was an&nbsp;important ship that served for nearly 50&nbsp;years. At&nbsp;the time they finally found&nbsp;it, the ship had been under those floorboards for almost 200&nbsp;years!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/73e/580/b838045fbea5c1ee57113e5f80.png><p>How about a&nbsp;curious Viking treasure hidden under a&nbsp;floorboard? Does that sound like something you’d like to&nbsp;hear about? The story goes that around the year 870, a&nbsp;wealthy Viking hid his treasure under the flooring of&nbsp;a&nbsp;building. It&nbsp;was located on&nbsp;the Swedish island of&nbsp;Gotland. It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;staggering 1000 years for a&nbsp;local farmer to&nbsp;discover&nbsp;it!</p><p>The impressive finding contained thousands of&nbsp;silver coins, dozens of&nbsp;silver bars, hundreds of&nbsp;bracelets, rings, and necklaces, and over 40&nbsp;pounds of&nbsp;bronze. In&nbsp;case you’re wondering how much that was all worth, well, roughly a&nbsp;half million dollars. The farmer wasn’t able to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it, though, as&nbsp;according to&nbsp;Swedish law, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;hand it&nbsp;over to&nbsp;authorities to&nbsp;analyze, document, and showcase it&nbsp;in&nbsp;various museums.</p><p>Some people even ended up&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;whole hot tub under their floorboards. Judging by&nbsp;the way it&nbsp;looked, it&nbsp;must have been some sort of&nbsp;an&nbsp;outside spa center because it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;filter lid and was also surrounded by&nbsp;pebblecrete. The previous homeowners probably wanted to&nbsp;cover it&nbsp;up&nbsp;after they’ve decided to&nbsp;extend the house, so&nbsp;the intricate bathtub remained undercover for quite some time.</p><p>One homeowner even managed to&nbsp;connect with the previous owners of&nbsp;his house. Well, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, at&nbsp;least. When he&nbsp;started removing the cork floor tiles in&nbsp;his house, he&nbsp;found a&nbsp;secret message from the original owners [The First Cork Tile Laid Here Sunday 28th Of&nbsp;March 1988] followed by&nbsp;four names, probably the names of&nbsp;the whole family that used to&nbsp;live there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/877/2cf/eab353505eaab5d5284b743850.png><p>While in&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;replacing her old carpet, a&nbsp;woman stumbled upon something that was both interesting aaand a&nbsp;bit weird. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;she started tearing the flooring apart, she found a&nbsp;cellar door. And as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was opened, and she started making her way down, she discovered a&nbsp;secret basement with shelves filled with jars. Some of&nbsp;them were empty, true, but some were filled with fruits. Maybe it&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;pantry? Or&nbsp;maybe it&nbsp;was hiding a&nbsp;more scary secret? I&nbsp;guess we’ll never know.</p><p>Europe was a&nbsp;hard place to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the 1400s as&nbsp;hospitals were often overwhelmed with patients. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence, they had to&nbsp;shut down some of&nbsp;these establishments completely and, at&nbsp;times, abandon them altogether when there were no&nbsp;doctors left to&nbsp;treat people.</p><p>But back in&nbsp;2013, they discovered what was left of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those hospitals in&nbsp;Madrid when a&nbsp;Spanish construction crew began digging for the new Apple Store! From the looks of&nbsp;it, the hospital dated back to&nbsp;the 15th century. It&nbsp;still worked well into the 19th century, but they eventually closed it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the 1850s and left it&nbsp;unused ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4ed/525/117f1957f08dbabeafe88c2403.png><p>Looking under your floorboards may prove to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;unique way to&nbsp;make some new friends, too. At&nbsp;least virtually. When Alex Moss, based in&nbsp;Manchester, England, moved into a&nbsp;new home, he&nbsp;decided it&nbsp;was time for some new hardwood floors. When removing the old ones, he&nbsp;stumbled upon a&nbsp;note written by&nbsp;the previous tenant, which was curious, to&nbsp;say the least. And it&nbsp;was signed by&nbsp;someone named Darren Lucas.</p><p>Alex didn’t freak out because of&nbsp;the unusual promise. Instead, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;track down the previous owner, and he&nbsp;eventually found him, thanks to&nbsp;the magical powers of&nbsp;Twitter. Safe to&nbsp;say, they had quite the laugh on&nbsp;the subject. Darren isn’t watching anymore, that’s for sure.</p><p>On&nbsp;an&nbsp;Albany farm in&nbsp;Western Australia, a&nbsp;family discovered a&nbsp;love letter that appeared to&nbsp;have dated back to&nbsp;the 1800s! The writing was beautiful in&nbsp;itself, and it&nbsp;came with an&nbsp;interesting surprise. There was a&nbsp;special paper embroidered with the words “remember&nbsp;me.” Awww!</p><p>They soon linked it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman named Phebe Mundy, who wrote the letter to&nbsp;a&nbsp;mysterious Mr. Trotman. Local historians could find no&nbsp;other information on&nbsp;either person, but by&nbsp;the tone of&nbsp;the letter, they believe it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;draft by&nbsp;a&nbsp;young woman writing to&nbsp;an&nbsp;older man of&nbsp;a&nbsp;different social class.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/76a/a13/3b3f1b573e8344e0fde64bb718.png><p>Another location came with a&nbsp;hidden secret in&nbsp;the floorboard itself: a&nbsp;hidden diary! A&nbsp;carpenter wrote it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;the floorboards of&nbsp;a&nbsp;French Alpine château somewhere in&nbsp;the late 19th century. When the new owners of&nbsp;the castle started renovating the parquet in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;their upstairs rooms, they found many things written on&nbsp;the underside of&nbsp;the floorboards.</p><p>Those weren’t visible until they took the floorboards up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;replaced. These long messages written out in&nbsp;pencil were dated over several months between the years 1880 and 1881. They were all signed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;man called Joachim Martin.</p><p>They soon figured out he&nbsp;must have been the carpenter who installed the flooring for the château’s owners back then. What he&nbsp;intended with his writing was to&nbsp;leave behind a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret diary that someone would access only once he&nbsp;was long gone. The whole journal contains some 72&nbsp;entries of&nbsp;varying lengths. Some of&nbsp;them contained purely factual information, while some were more personal, especially the ones about his family, friends, and community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5d0/47d/28f8fb56559d45df91c7709d9d.png><p>In&nbsp;May 2016, they revealed the new look of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bedroom in&nbsp;George Washington’s Mount Vernon home to&nbsp;the public, based partially on&nbsp;the discovery of&nbsp;tiny fragments of&nbsp;wallpaper hidden under the bedroom’s floorboards. These tiny fragments were none wider than a&nbsp;half an&nbsp;inch.</p><p>But based on&nbsp;forensic paint analysis of&nbsp;these fascinating scraps, they managed to&nbsp;establish that the wallpapers originally had strikingly beautiful colors and a&nbsp;lavish chintz pattern. It&nbsp;really was a&nbsp;far cry from the simple and dull design that curators had previously believed the room used to&nbsp;look like.</p><p>This whole process, along with other recently discovered historic memorabilia, allowed researchers to&nbsp;redecorate the room and actually bring it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;its former glory, painting a&nbsp;better picture of&nbsp;what the style used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;back then and what it&nbsp;used to&nbsp;look like in&nbsp;18th-century homes.
