The professional choreographer recently surprised her fellow former Dancing With The Stars pro alongside her friends to celebrate Arnold’s birthday with an intimate dinner.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-witney-carson-friends-surprises-lindsay-arnold-with-an-early-birthday-dinner>Witney Carson, Friends Surprises Lindsay Arnold with an Early Birthday Dinner</h2><p>In an Instagram Story, Arnold uploaded a short clip of her friends, Brooklyn Larsen and Heather Larson, appearing at her house in the middle of the night. The two apparently went to her place unannounced to surprise the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro to greet her for her special day.</p><p>“Lol truly had NO idea what was going on when my sweet friends @brooklynlarz and @heatherhat showed up at my house to kidnap me for dinner,” she wrote.</p><p>In a later story, Arnold revealed that her friends decided to do a surprise for her. In the video, her pals were singing “Happy Birthday,” as she was sitting in front of cupcakes that feature candles of the numbers 30. The clip also featured her blowing the cake while smiling at her friends.</p><p>“My sweetest friends put together an early birthday surprise for me and it seriously meant the world to me! Love them all so much,” she wrote.</p><p>Among the friends who attended Arnold’s birthday dinner was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carson</a>, who has been Arnold’s longtime friend. Carson gave a glimpse of the chaotic yet happy night on her Instagram Story posts. The DWTS pro uploaded a photo of them together during dinner, alongside a message for the birthday girl.</p><p>“Early bday dinner for @lindsayarnold. She’s kind, incredibly talented, stunning, hilarious, smart, easy to talk to and just an all around good human! Here’s to many more birthdays celebrating together! Love you my sis!” she wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-both-are-enjoying-the-mom-life>Both are Enjoying the Mom Life</h2><p>It’s no secret that Arnold and Carson have decided to focus on being mom in the past years. That meant giving up their gigs on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a>. For those who may not know, Arnold didn’t return for season 32 of the dancing competition series after skipping the previous year.</p><p>“I’ve really been considering the option and seeing if it’s something we can fit into our life … and ultimately this season is not gonna work out for me and my family,” she said.</p><p>In the same vein, Carson announced she needed to take a break from DWTS to attend to the needs of her son.</p><p>“Leo’s at an age where he needs consistency and dependability and he hasn’t had that ever since he’s been born. So we’re just really trying to give him that now. I also feel like I’m not quite mentally and physically ready for what the show calls for,” she said.</p><p>Indeed, the two have seized their moments with their babies throughout the year. Carson and Arnold have been sharing some of their family moments on Instagram, from their simple bonding sessions at home to their cozy getaways.</p><p>Arnold shares two daughters, Sage Jill and June, with husband Samuel Lightner Cusick. Meanwhile, Carson shares Kevin Leo and Jet Carson, with husband Carson McAllister.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_DerekHough_JenniferLopez-220x147.jpg alt="Derek Hough Becomes One of Jennifer Lopez’s Grooms in New Music Video for “Can’t Get Enough”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuw8itpZ6xXZius7%2FOp2Sfqpmau6W%2FjK2fq6enYsC2vs%2BroKydXZe2s8DHnZiyZZSeu6%2Bx0WadqKpdobavsNKasGaZoqO8rbCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
