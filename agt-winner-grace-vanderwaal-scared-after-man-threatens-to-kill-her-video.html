The 16-year-old spoke about how someone held a gun up to his head when she chatted with him on the website. “Oh my god I’m scared,” she said repeatedly during the live stream. But she shifted gears and began answering questions from fans. Grace sported her shaved head that she dyed pink long with rhinestones on her teeth and underneath her eyes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>It didn’t take long for Grace’s fans to continuously ask why she kept saying that she was scared. “A dude literally screamed at me and told me he was going to kill me and find my IP Address,” she said. “I feel like I’m in sixth grade…it’s so stupid but I’m literally scared.” She proceeded to call it “genuinely scary.” A fan commented that the most someone can do is find what city Grace is in currently. Grace responded that she is not currently in the city that she lives in at the moment.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">THE LEGACY GRACE VANDERWAAL HAS CREATED SINCE WINNING ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’</a></strong></p><p>“You look like James Charles,” one fan wrote. Grace let out a giggle but said “I literally can’t laugh, I’m sorry.” She added that when she went onto Omegle, the worst thing she thought she was going to see was males exposing their genitals. The America’s Got Talent winner brought her dog over to come sit in her lap and declared that she wasn’t scared anymore. “I’m not on anything,” she said when a fan asked a question about whether or not she was on drugs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJjLRlpjdcv/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-grace-teased-new-music-coming-out-and-spoke-on-her-new-look>Grace Teased New Music Coming Out And Spoke On Her New Look</h3><p>In some lighter news, Grace did say she will be coming out with more original music in the future.
