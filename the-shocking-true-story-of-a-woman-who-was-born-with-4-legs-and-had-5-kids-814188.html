But there was more to&nbsp;it. She also had 2&nbsp;sets of&nbsp;reproductive organs and 2&nbsp;pelvises. Because of&nbsp;this rare occurrence, she’s probably one of&nbsp;the few people in&nbsp;history considered wonders. Let’s delve into Myrtle’s story and discover her exceptional life milestones.</p><p><h2>Myrtle was considered a&nbsp;rare and remarkable case of&nbsp;human development.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d8/214/90444d52c3a60d6c969b6931ec.jpg><p>Josephine Myrtle Corbin, an&nbsp;American sideshow performer, came into the world in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1868</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;remarkable medical rarity. Affected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;condition known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dipygus</a>, she possessed two lower bodies from the waist down. This unusual phenomenon occurred due to&nbsp;her body axis splitting during development, resulting in&nbsp;two separate pelvises side by&nbsp;side. Remarkably, her smaller inner legs were paired with one of&nbsp;her outer legs. While Myrtle could move her inner legs, but they were too weak to&nbsp;walk&nbsp;on.</p><p>Born in&nbsp;Tennessee to&nbsp;her parents, William and Nancy, Myrtle’s arrival brought both wonder and concern. At&nbsp;25, her father, William, and 34-year-old mother, Nancy, welcomed the unique little Myrtle into their lives. Medical professionals noted that if&nbsp;Myrtle had been delivered breech, with her bottom first, it&nbsp;could have been potentially fatal for both her and her mother. Thankfully, Myrtle’s early days were promising, as&nbsp;she displayed signs of&nbsp;strength, weighing 10&nbsp;lb (4.5kg) just 3&nbsp;weeks after her birth.</p><h2><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Myrtle’s father</a> was facing financial hardship and had to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;ways to&nbsp;support his growing family.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c45/b41/99e8645d77ae041059ea2c0f40.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;5&nbsp;weeks, people had the opportunity to&nbsp;visit William Corbin and marvel at&nbsp;his four-legged daughter for a&nbsp;small fee. As&nbsp;the years passed, Myrtle grew up&nbsp;accustomed to&nbsp;the constant stares and astonishment from those who encountered her rare condition. Her inner legs never fully developed, her right foot was clubbed, and both of&nbsp;the smaller legs had 3&nbsp;toes on&nbsp;each foot.</p><p>Over the following decade, William took Myrtle on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey across the country, where she participated in&nbsp;fairs, sideshows, and dime museums. By&nbsp;the time she turned&nbsp;14, she had achieved success and managed to&nbsp;secure a&nbsp;lucrative contract paying her an&nbsp;unusually high salary of&nbsp;$250 per week.</p><p>The four-legged girl, Myrtle, had a&nbsp;younger sister named Ann, who fortunately did not suffer from any birth defects.</p><p><h2>Myrtle married when she was 18&nbsp;and later became a&nbsp;mother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ad/baf/c8f6e352fca2cff9f9c6955102.jpg><p>As&nbsp;Myrtle entered adulthood, she grew weary of&nbsp;the constant attention she received due to&nbsp;her condition. At&nbsp;18, she decided to&nbsp;marry James Bicknell, a&nbsp;medical student, after which she retired from her performing career. Interestingly, her fame had inspired others to&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;fake her unique deformity, but all of&nbsp;these impostors were eventually exposed as&nbsp;frauds.</p><p>A&nbsp;year into their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, Myrtle experienced troubling symptoms like fever, <a href=# title=nausea data-link=tag>nausea</a>, headaches, and side pains. Concerned, she sought medical attention, and to&nbsp;her disbelief, the doctor revealed that she was pregnant on&nbsp;her left side. Myrtle skeptically responded, saying, “If&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been on&nbsp;my&nbsp;right side, I&nbsp;would come nearer believing you are correct.” The <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> proved challenging for her health, and doctors even advised her to&nbsp;consider an&nbsp;abortion due to&nbsp;the severity of&nbsp;her illness. However, Myrtle managed to&nbsp;recover swiftly.</p><p>Over the following years, James and Myrtle welcomed seven more children into their family. Tragically, only 5&nbsp;of&nbsp;them survived infancy, 4&nbsp;daughters and a&nbsp;son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f71/be8/a94ec0557bbcfca9649302aed7.jpg><p>The family lived a&nbsp;quiet life until their 5&nbsp;children reached adulthood. Then Myrtle re-entered the show business. In&nbsp;1909, when Myrtle was&nbsp;41, she was a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;Huber’s Museum exhibit, appearing as&nbsp;The Four-Legged Girl from Cleburne, Texas. She often dressed her 4&nbsp;legs in&nbsp;matching shoes and socks, to&nbsp;the audience’s delight. She was making $450 per week at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>In&nbsp;1928, Myrtle developed a&nbsp;skin infection on&nbsp;her right leg, and the doctor diagnosed her with erysipelas or&nbsp;a&nbsp;strep infection. A&nbsp;week later, on&nbsp;May 6th, 1928, Myrtle passed away. Her casket was covered in&nbsp;concrete, and family members kept watch until it&nbsp;was fully cured to&nbsp;prevent grave robbers from stealing her remains.</p><p>Almost a&nbsp;century later, Josephine Myrtle Corbin Bicknell continues to&nbsp;inspire others by&nbsp;proving that even in&nbsp;the 19th century,<a href=#> a&nbsp;woman could forge a&nbsp;successful career and become a&nbsp;mother</a> all at&nbsp;once.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysn6ibm567qHnTq6yeZaOpvLPFjKidZpldrLyurc1mrqGnXayutHnBqKmnZaeewal5k2ajnp%2BjYq6vsIyhmJ1lZWK4qrDSZm9qbGFthXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
