He’s not the first violinist to take the stage and bring lively energy to their performances. But will he go as far as his predecessors?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-america-s-got-talent-s-newest-violinist-alex-rivers>Meet America’s Got Talent‘s Newest Violinist, Alex Rivers</h2><p>Alex, a 26-year-old violinist from Las Vegas, actually had two auditions for the show. The first time, Simon Cowell said he hated the track he chose, and suggested the musician should return with something else. So Alex came back the next day to perform “New Rules” by Dua Lipa.</p><p>He played on a colorful light-up violin and showed off some dance moves as he performed. Alex had the audience dancing and clapping along as he owned the stage. He ultimately earned a standing ovation from Cowell for the performance.</p><p>Alex <a href=#>commented</a> on the YouTube video of his performance, writing that he “never in a billion years thought that my life would leave playing on a Vegas sidewalk for passerbys.” He encouraged fans to listen to his recent album Impact.</p><p>Can Alex go as far in the competition as past violinists like him? Let’s take a look back at their AGT journeys and success after the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-lindsey-stirling>1.

She told the judges she played “hip-hop violin,” going on to play the instrument while moving around the stage, at one point bending backwards while she played.</p><p>The judges loved Lindsey’s performance and gave her three “yes” votes to move on. She ended up making it to the Quarterfinals, where she was eliminated. However, that didn’t keep Lindsey from success. She’s released five albums, performed on a number of tours, and racked up over 13 million YouTube subscribers.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘AGT’ ALUM ANGELICA HALE CELEBRATES A HUGE CAREER MILESTONE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-brian-king-joseph>2.
