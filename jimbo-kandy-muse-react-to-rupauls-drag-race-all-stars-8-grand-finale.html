The two queens were still oblivious of the results amid filming, so that makes their reaction real and raw.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimbo, Kandy Muse Record Live Reaction to Drag Race All Stars 8 Finale</h2><p>Channeling their usual drag persona, Jimbo and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kandy Muse</a> took the time to watch the final episode. Together, the queens recounted their original numbers, “I Remember Being Born” and “Pay Me In Money” for Jimbo and Kandy respectively.</p><p>The two also watched their face-off for the Lip Sync challenge, seeing the both of them give their all to “Do Ya Wanna Funk?” by Sylvester and Patrick Cowley. Subsequently, by the time it was the moment for RuPaul to announce the winner, Jimbo’s nerves started to kick in. Meanwhile, Muse remained calm and composed, almost as if she knew the result prior to the revelation.</p><p>“Ladies, based on the Lip Sync and your performances all season long, I’ve made my decision,” RuPaul said. “The winner of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drag Race All Stars 8</a>, the queen about to be inducted into the Drag Race Hall of Fame is … Jimbo!”</p><p>Upon hearing her name, the Canadian drag queen immediately screamed out of joy. Still trying to absorb the result, the two queens hugged each other and shared a friendly smooch to celebrate.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winner-thanks-rupaul-charles-for-letting-her-come-back>Winner Thanks RuPaul Charles for Letting Her Come Back</h2><p>It’s definitely a groundbreaking and historic win for Jimbo who had to join three times before snatching a crown. Talking to People, the comedic drag clown says she’s “on top of the world” after achieving her dream feat.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimbo</a>, it “feels so good” to have her hard work paid off. On her end, the victory is ultimately tasteful for someone like her who made a career out of drag. As she seized the milestone, Jimbo didn’t forget to express her gratitude towards Charles and the whole cast of the series.</p><p>“I’m just so grateful to Mamma Ru and the whole team at World of Wonder for giving me the chance to come back and showcase what I can do,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “Looking back, of course, I was disappointed to not have won those previous seasons. But I believe that everything happens for a reason. And I knew in those moments that the loss was just an opportunity for me to take advantage of all the feedback I had gotten at that time and be better.”</p><p>Aside from the coveted crown, Jimbo obtained the show’s cash prize of $200,000. She will then gear up to hit the road for a 56-city North American solo tour next year. Next February, she’ll also be appearing for Queens Gone Wild Cruise along with Kandy Muse, Jessica Wild and Heidi N Closet.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_HarryStyles3_JMEnternationalGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Harry Styles Celebrates a Spectacular End to His Iconic ‘Love on Tour’ Concert Series" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaKkm6ddoK6vsNhmpK6rlWK%2Fpq3CrWStp12nwrGt1KWqZpyilrRuvsCcnGaZnKF6tMDAq6pmcF2cv6K6w2adoqaRobJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
