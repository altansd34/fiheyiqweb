One performer in particular was out of this world: Space Bunny! He had the voice and energy to back up his wacky costume.</strong></p><p id=block-ec54152b-1089-49da-a7f2-8064eee228ac>But who is the celebrity behind the Space Bunny mask? Let’s look at all the clues and make a prediction!</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 7</h2><p>Before the season, we saw a first clue that was the state of North Carolina with an NC in it and a star.</p><p>Space Bunny blasted into his <a href=#>clue-mercial</a> by starting…in an office? He asks, “are you tired from a long career trailblazing all over the galaxy?” He gets stung in the nose by a bee, then a red handprint is shown on a piece of paper in a printer. Space Bunny is selling an energy drink called Space Boost. He says, “be a hero and cover all your bases with Space Boost energy drink.” He claims that it’s “safe, long-lasting…with no side effects!” The infomercial says there are side effects though.</p><p>When Space Bunny is blasting away, we see a basketball on fire flying by him, then a dog. He and one of the Men in Black fly through the air to end the clue package. After his performance, Space Bunny said, “I shoot for the moon in everything I do! I like the wardrobe.” He also joked with Nick Cannon and did some fun callouts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=een30fvzSYc</p>The Masked Singer Space Bunny performs “Jump In The Line” by Harry Belafonte</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Space Bunny</h2><p id=block-adeca979-196e-403e-bb95-1765dad45339>Robin saw the clues and thought it was Damien Lillard, but once he heard the voice, he started to think it was a Caribbean singer like Sean Paul, Shabba Ranks, or Buju Banton. Nicole picks up on that and guesses Shaggy, but Robin says he doesn’t hear that tone as much. Nicole then predicts it’s Lebron James, due to the basketball and energy drink clues.</p><p id=block-f08aca59-398d-4a40-aa8f-f690593f1540>Online, guesses are pretty much all going toward Shaggy, but some also mention Sean Paul, Sean Kingston, and George Lopez.</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;RECAP + RINGMASTER PREDICTION</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is Space Bunny on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-4f540236-784e-4f7a-a2cc-07e1b50dc01b>Honestly, this voice is familiar for a lot of reasons. For people like me, who grew up listening to hip-hop music that was heavily influenced by Reggae, the tones and style are similar to a few different performers. But looking at all the clues, there’s only one person that could be under the mask.</p><p id=block-4257397c-dcb8-4e72-868b-b2ba514f46a0>That being said, Space Bunny has to be…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-2b3ac430-3a19-4834-aea3-1890a50a164c><strong>Shaggy!</strong></h2><p id=block-786a6bcf-c622-4ad5-9c93-d6ae45362ee1>When the people know, they know. And honestly, it doesn’t take many clues to figure out this one with his distinct voice! But here are all the clues anyway.</p><p>First of all, that accent helps guide the predictions. Shaggy is Jamaican, so that makes sense! The North Carolina clue we saw in the “sneak peek” is a nod to his first single, “Oh Carolina.” When Space Bunny got stung by a bee, that was a reference to Shaggy’s tour and album with Sting. We also saw a red handprint, which is a direct tie to his most famous song, “It Wasn’t Me.” The lyrics say, “Honey came in and she caught me red-handed” which could be another hint from the bee!</p><p>The flaming basketball is easily explained by the fact that Shaggy’s hit album was called “Hot Shot.” The dog, as Nicole mentioned, was also very shaggy. Another dog connection Shaggy has it to Scooby-Doo, since he shares a name with one of the main characters on the show. In fact, Shaggy once remade the theme song for that show, calling it “Shaggy, Where Are You?”</p><p>And if all that weren’t enough, Shaggy recently appeared on another FOX reality show hosted by Ken Jeong, I Can See Your Voice. In the past, The Masked Singer alum have performed on that show as well, including Adrienne Bailon-Houghton, Nick Lachey, Kelly Obsourne, Donny Osmond, Bob Saget, Jesse McCartney, Katharine McPhee, Bow Wow, Jewel, Brian Austin Green, LeAnn Rimes, Margaret Cho, and Kandi Burruss. Clearly there’s a casting trend here!</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-de86c8bb-faa8-4151-b70b-9eb50cfe24dc><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;FIREFLY</a> | <a href=#>RINGMASTER</a> | <a href=#>BABY MAMMOTH</a> | <a href=#>QUEEN COBRA</a> | <a href=#>PRINCE</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-24-at-10.04.19-PM.png alt="‘American Idol’ Recap: Gabby Barrett Returns as Mentor Before Top 11 Reveal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrKeam5Vir7a6zbJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
