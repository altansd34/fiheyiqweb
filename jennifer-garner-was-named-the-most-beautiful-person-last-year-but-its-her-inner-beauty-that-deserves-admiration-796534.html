She is&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredible mom and Ben Affleck recognizes this, even after their breakup</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31b/c84/d70d62546da54a05f28bc149fb.jpg><p>Jennifer Garner is&nbsp;a&nbsp;devoted mother who tries to&nbsp;pick her 3&nbsp;children up&nbsp;from school daily and spends as&nbsp;much time with them as&nbsp;possible. Last year on&nbsp;Mother’s Day her ex-husband <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> praised her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“mother who has shown me&nbsp;the meaning of&nbsp;love.”</p><p><h2>2. She’s known what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hardworking person since her childhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/47b/b07/27281853a6b40a9c46d35a9ecd.jpg><p>Her first experience with being on&nbsp;stage was thanks to&nbsp;her passion for ballet. Since she was a&nbsp;child, she practiced this demanding discipline that instilled in&nbsp;her that only real effort brings success. To&nbsp;this day she continues to&nbsp;practice <a href=#>ballet</a>, although she has also added boxing to&nbsp;her <a href=#>training</a>. She is&nbsp;definitely a&nbsp;fighter.</p><p><h2>3. Fame has not changed her and she chooses to&nbsp;be&nbsp;natural.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b70/930/0e4faf539f8fe181d907626973.jpg><p>Garner shares pieces of&nbsp;her life on&nbsp;her Instagram account where she doesn’t care about appearing without makeup or&nbsp;even in&nbsp;her nightgown. She always <a href=#>chooses</a> joy over perfection. We&nbsp;can see her out getting <a href=#>coffee</a> in&nbsp;the early morning or&nbsp;<a href=#>wearing</a> a&nbsp;lovely scarf that her son knitted for her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;birthday present, even if&nbsp;it’s not the most glamorous accessory to&nbsp;wear.</p><p><h2>4. Her most rewarding job is&nbsp;being a&nbsp;Save the Children ambassador.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/549/db7/1dc0825ccc878fdb800f8bbcba.jpg><p>For more than a&nbsp;decade she has been advocating for Save the Children’s early education programs. She is&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;pushing for better access to&nbsp;high-quality early childhood education and giving boys and girls around the world a&nbsp;healthy start. As&nbsp;she <a href=#>declared</a>, this is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most important actions she can undertake.</p><p><h2>5. She loves animals, and not just her dog, but her chickens too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1eb/6f2/72136d5f7aaf89ce00bb9edfa2.jpg><p>Jennifer Garner has <a href=#>hens</a> at&nbsp;home. She used to&nbsp;<a href=#>say</a> that if&nbsp;there isn’t a&nbsp;Chicken Lady Day, there really should&nbsp;be. She is&nbsp;definitely one and takes care of&nbsp;them as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;she does of&nbsp;her dog. She walks them, gives them their favorite food, and funnily says she “has naming rights on&nbsp;them.” She named 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;her chickens Regina George and Hennifer.</p><p><h2>6. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;supportive friend.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/259/681/71b811589eb6ebbb98d59d4638.jpg><p>Her friends can count on&nbsp;her during good and bad times. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;colleague premieres a&nbsp;series or&nbsp;releases their first movie, Garner is&nbsp;there to&nbsp;praise their work and, above all, remind them how great they are.</p><p><h2>7. She is&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;the people who believed in&nbsp;her talent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ee9/6d6/492fa850e78e4f801e92ba172f.jpg><p>She feels lucky to&nbsp;have had <a href=#>teachers</a> that saw her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;creative person and thanked her high school librarian, who thought that she was worthy of&nbsp;her time and attention. She is&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;those special people in&nbsp;her life for helping her to&nbsp;become who she is&nbsp;today.</p><p><h2>8. She shares her love for a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle with others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e66/0ff/1093925ae6a2a2c314fb456e9d.jpg><p>She claims to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;farmer girl and shares healthy <a href=#>recipes</a>. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, she is&nbsp;co-founder of&nbsp;Once Upon A&nbsp;Farm, an&nbsp;organic baby food company. Through this project, she wants to&nbsp;<a href=#>remind</a>&nbsp;us how magical our soil is&nbsp;and how lucky we&nbsp;are to&nbsp;put its gifts directly into our kids’ hands.</p><p><h2>9. She bypassed insecurity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84e/7ce/ec9f3f532fae84b7411a8c8cad.jpg><p>She was not the most beautiful girl in&nbsp;school, but this never stopped her. As&nbsp;she remembers, she was never the <a href=#>prom queen</a>. Nevertheless, even if&nbsp;she was not the prettiest child, she thinks that “nerds laugh more” anyway.</p><p><h2>10. She’s maintained an&nbsp;excellent relationship with the father of&nbsp;her children after their divorce.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/595/9a6/7a6639533f95c6b5748130f48c.jpg><p>Jennifer helped her then-husband overcome his alcohol addiction and their <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> has not stopped them from making plans together for the good of&nbsp;their children. What’s more, she continues supporting him in&nbsp;his career. The director of&nbsp;the film The Way Back <a href=#>recognized</a> that when Affleck almost lost the role, due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;relapse, Garner called him and convinced him to&nbsp;not pull the plug on&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>11. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fully-involved activist.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e71/b53/dc61ba51f6a545b600ea551ef1.jpg><p>Even though she spends a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;her time supporting struggling children, Jennifer Garner also has time to&nbsp;get involved with other <a href=#>charities</a>. In&nbsp;2014, she <a href=#>joined</a> the Invest in&nbsp;Us campaign where she appeared in&nbsp;A&nbsp;Path Appears, a&nbsp;PBS documentary that focuses on&nbsp;rural poverty among children in&nbsp;West Virginia.</p><p><h2>12. She is&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;her long-lasting girlfriend tribe.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06f/95f/abda04568a915fe799c2ed6c48.jpg><p>She is&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;maintaining long-lasting friendships. As&nbsp;she <a href=#>said</a>, “There is&nbsp;nothing more important, other than your kids—no man, no&nbsp;relationship, no&nbsp;anything—than your girlfriends.” Nothing makes her happier than starting a&nbsp;great friendship again on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new shoot, like the case with her friend Maika Monroe.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the best quality she has as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright person?
